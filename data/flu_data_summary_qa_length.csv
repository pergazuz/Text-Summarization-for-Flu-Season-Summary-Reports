2006-2007,How severe was the 2006-2007 flu season?,"The 2006-07 flu season was generally mild compared to recent flu seasons. For example, the proportion of all deaths associated with influenza illness was lower this season than the previous three flu seasons. Hospitalization rates among children were also lower than the previous three flu seasons. However, more pediatric deaths related to influenza were reported during the 2006-07 season than the previous two seasons. Nationally, low levels of flu activity were reported during October through mid-December. Flu activity increased during late December, peaked in mid-February, and decreased through the end of the flu season on May 19.","Flu activity increased during late December, peaked in mid-February, and decreased through the end of the flu season on May 19.","For example, the proportion of all deaths associated with influenza illness was lower this season than the previous three flu seasons.","For example, the proportion of all deaths associated with influenza illness was lower this season than the previous three flu seasons.","The 2006-07 flu season was generally mild compared to recent flu seasons.

2006-2007,How many people died from flu during the 2006-07 season?,"Exact numbers of how many people died from flu this season cannot be determined. Flu-associated deaths are only a nationally notifiable condition among children, and states are not required to report flu cases or to report adult deaths from influenza to CDC. In addition, many people who die of complications from flu infection are not tested for flu, or they seek medical care later in their illness when influenza can no longer be detected from respiratory samples. However, CDC tracks pneumonia and flu deaths through the 122 Cities Mortality Reporting System. This system collects information each week on the total number of death certificates filed in each of the 122 participating cities and the number of death certificates with pneumonia or influenza listed as a cause of death. This system helps gauge the severity of the flu season compared with other years, but does not specifically estimate the number of flu-associated deaths. Estimates of flu-associated deaths are made by modeling death certificate data from the National Center for Health Statistics and from CDC influenza virus surveillance data.

2006-2007,Was there a good match between the influenza strains selected for the vaccine and the strains that circulated during the 2006-07 season?,"The influenza A (H1) component of the 2006-07 flu vaccine was well matched to circulating influenza A (H1) viruses, which accounted for the majority of influenza viruses tested by CDC. There are two groups of influenza B viruses currently circulating, which are known as the B/Yamagata lineage viruses and the B/Victoria lineage viruses. The 2006-07 vaccine contained a B virus from the B/Victoria lineage and 77% of the viruses tested by CDC were from the B/Victoria lineage. Fifty percent of the influenza B viruses characterized as belonging to the B/Victoria lineage were well matched to the influenza B component of the 2006-07 flu vaccine. In the early months of the season, the majority of influenza A (H3) viruses circulating in the country matched the influenza A (H3N2) component of the 2006�07 vaccine. However, the proportion of H3N2 viruses similar to the H3N2 vaccine component declined as the season progressed. Overall for the 2006-07 season, 24 percent of H3N2 viruses were well matched to the vaccine strain.","Overall for the 2006-07 season, 24 percent of H3N2 viruses were well matched to the vaccine strain.","In the early months of the season, the majority of influenza A (H3) viruses circulating in the country matched the influenza A (H3N2) component of the 2006�07 vaccine.",Fifty percent of the influenza B viruses characterized as belonging to the B/Victoria lineage were well matched to the influenza B component of the 2006-07 flu vaccine.,"The influenza A (H1) component of the 2006-07 flu vaccine was well matched to circulating viruses.

2006-2007,What can be done to protect children from flu-associated illness and death?,"Vaccination remains the best method for preventing flu and its potentially severe complications in children. October or November is the best time to get vaccinated, but getting vaccinated in December or even later can still be beneficial, since most flu activity occurs in January or later in most years. Though it varies, the flu season can last as late as May and sporadic cases of flu occur year round.\nAll children 6 months of age to their 5th birthday are recommended for influenza vaccination. In addition, all children with chronic medical conditions such as asthma should get the flu vaccine. Household contacts and caregivers of these children are also recommended for annual vaccination.\nChildren younger than 6 months of age are at high risk of influenza complications, but are too young to get a flu vaccine. The best way to protect these children is to vaccinate their household members and out-of-home caregivers.\nChildren receiving flu vaccine for the first time need to receive two doses their first year, with the first dose ideally given in September. For inactivated vaccine (the flu shot), the second dose is given four or more weeks after the first dose. For live attenuated flu vaccine (nasal spray vaccine), the second dose can be administered six weeks after the first dose. The flu shot is approved for children 6 months of age and older. The nasal spray vaccine is approved for healthy children 5 years of age and older. Children with asthma or other conditions should get the flu shot instead of the nasal spray.",Children with asthma or other conditions should get the flu shot instead of the nasal spray.,"Household contacts and caregivers of these children are also recommended for annual vaccination.\nChildren younger than 6 months of age are at high risk of influenza complications, but are too young to get a flu vaccine.

2007-2008,What flu viruses circulated this season?,"In the United States, influenza A (H1N1), A (H3N2) and B viruses co-circulated throughout the season. Influenza A viruses accounted for 71% of the specimens testing positive for flu by public health laboratories while influenza B viruses accounted for 29%.\nEarly in the season, influenza A (H1N1) viruses predominated, however, as the season progressed, an increasing proportion of sub-typed* influenza A viruses were influenza A (H3N2) viruses. Late in the season, when overall influenza activity was declining, influenza B viruses were more commonly reported than influenza A viruses. Overall, for the 2007-2008 U.S. flu season, influenza A (H3N2) viruses were most commonly reported.\n* Subtyping is the process of identifying an influenza A virus by its genetic and antigenic (biological) properties to determine if it is an influenza A (H3N2) or influenza A (H1N1) virus. Flu A viruses are subtyped in public health laboratories, such as state department of health laboratories and CDC Influenza Division laboratories.","Flu A viruses are subtyped in public health laboratories, such as state department of health laboratories and CDC Influenza Division laboratories.","Influenza A viruses accounted for 71% of the specimens testing positive for flu by public health laboratories while influenza B viruses accounted for 29%.\nEarly in the season, influenza A (H1N1) viruses predominated, however, as the season progressed, an increasing proportion of sub-typed* influenza A viruses were influenza A (H3N2) viruses.","Influenza A viruses accounted for 71% of the specimens testing positive for flu by public health laboratories while influenza B viruses accounted for 29%.nEarly in the season, influenza A (H1N1) viruses predominated, however, as the season progressed, an increasing proportion of sub-typed* influenza A viruses were influenza A (H3N2) viruses."," Influenza A viruses accounted for 71% of the specimens testing positive for flu by public health laboratories.

2007-2008,Why were two of the three strains in this season�s flu vaccine less than optimally matched to circulating viruses?,"Flu viruses are always changing. They can change from the time the vaccine is recommended and the beginning of the flu season, or they can even change during a flu season. Each year, experts study thousands of flu virus samples from around the world to figure out which viruses are making people sick and how these viruses are changing. With this information, they forecast which three viruses are most likely to make the most people sick during the next flu season. Each year, the seasonal influenza vaccine contains three influenza virus strains � one influenza A (H3N2) virus, one influenza A (H1N1) virus, and one influenza B virus. The selection of which viruses to include in the vaccine must be made in February of the prior year in order for vaccine to be produced in time for distribution the following season. For this reason, there is always the possibility of a less than optimal match between viruses in the vaccine and circulating viruses. For more information about the vaccine strain selection process, visit Selecting the Viruses in the Influenza (Flu) Vaccine.\nIn terms of the influenza A (H3N2) virus strain selection for the 2007-2008 vaccine, in February of 2007, there were few influenza A (H3N2) virus samples available to guide the selection of the H3N2 vaccine component. While the H3N2 A/Brisbane-like virus that became the predominant virus in the U.S. this season first emerged in Australia in 2007, there was no clear indication that this virus would become the predominant virus causing illness. In addition, there were very few influenza A (H3N2) samples and nothing suitable as a strain for vaccine production. For this reason, the World Health Organization and the Vaccines and Related Biologicals Advisory Committee in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommended that the influenza A (H3N2) component of the 2007-2008 influenza vaccine would remain the same as the previous season because influenza A (H3N2) viruses similar to the vaccine strain were still circulating and no other candidate reference strains were available. CDC continued to monitor this situation closely and frequently updated information on circulating strains and public health and public education guidance based on this information throughout the season.\nIn terms of the selection of the B/Yamagata lineage for inclusion in the 2007-2008 vaccine, in February 2007, both B/Yamagata and B/Victoria viruses were co-circulating, however the B/Victoria lineage was predominant at the time. B/Victoria and B/Yamagata viruses are antigenically and genetically far apart. With two co-circulating B lineages, it�s more difficult to forecast which B lineage will predominate for the next season. At the time the vaccine virus selection decision was made, is was not yet clear that B/Yamagata viruses would become the predominant B viruses circulating in the United States this season.","At the time the vaccine virus selection decision was made, is was not yet clear that B/Yamagata viruses would become the predominant B viruses circulating in the United States this season.","For this reason, the World Health Organization and the Vaccines and Related Biologicals Advisory Committee in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommended that the influenza A (H3N2) component of the 2007-2008 influenza vaccine would remain the same as the previous season because influenza A (H3N2) viruses similar to the vaccine strain were still circulating and no other candidate reference strains were available.

2007-2008,Can the vaccine provide protection even if the vaccine is not a �good� match?,"Yes, antibodies made in response to vaccination with one strain of influenza viruses can provide protection against different, but related strains. A less than ideal match may result in reduced vaccine effectiveness against the variant viruses, but it can still provide enough protection to prevent or lessen illness severity and prevent flu-related complications. In addition, it�s important to remember that the influenza vaccine contains three virus strains so that even when there is a less than ideal match or lower effectiveness against one strain, the vaccine may protect against the other two viruses. For these reasons, even during seasons when there is a less than ideal match, CDC continues to recommend influenza vaccination. This is particularly important for people at high risk for serious flu complications and their close contacts.","For these reasons, even during seasons when there is a less than ideal match, CDC continues to recommend influenza vaccination.","A less than ideal match may result in reduced vaccine effectiveness against the variant viruses, but it can still provide enough protection to prevent or lessen illness severity and prevent flu-related complications.","In addition, it s important to remember that the influenza vaccine contains three virus strains so that even when there is a less than ideal match or lower effectiveness against one strain, the vaccine may protect against the other two viruses.","A less than ideal match can still provide enough protection to prevent or lessen illness severity and prevent flu-related complications.

2008-2009,When did the flu season peak?,"The weekly percentage of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) peaked at the end of October at 7.6%, a level higher than the three previous influenza seasons, as reported by the U.S. Outpatient ILI Surveillance Network (ILINet). This percentage decreased to 1.0% by the middle of May, 2010. The number of states reporting widespread influenza activity peaked at 49 at the end of October, and decreased to zero by the beginning of January. By the middle of May, no states were reporting widespread or regional influenza activity and most states were reporting sporadic or no flu activity. In most years, seasonal influenza activity peaks in January or February.

2008-2009,How severe was the season?,"2009 H1N1 activity was relatively more severe among people younger than 65 years of age compared with non-pandemic influenza seasons. Influenza activity was associated with significantly higher pediatric mortality, and higher rates of hospitalizations in children and young adults than previous seasons. The 2009-10 influenza season was relatively less severe among people 65 years and older than compared with usual flu seasons. Like seasonal flu, people with certain chronic medical conditions were at greater risk of serious flu complications during the 2009-10 pandemic season, including hospitalizations and deaths. In fact, an estimated 80% of adult hospitalizations and 65% of child hospitalizations related to 2009 H1N1 occurred in people with one or more underlying medical conditions1. Additional information about severity of the 2009-2010 season can be found in the�MMWR�article",Additional information about severity of the 2009-2010 season can be found in the�MMWR�article,2009 H1N1 activity was relatively more severe among people younger than 65 years of age compared with non-pandemic influenza seasons.,The 2009-10 influenza season was relatively less severe among people 65 years and older than compared with usual flu seasons., Influenza activity was associated with significantly higher pediatric mortality.

2008-2009,How effective is the seasonal flu vaccine?,"The ability of flu vaccine to protect a person depends on two things: 1) the age and health status of the person getting vaccinated, and 2) the similarity or �match� between the virus strains in the vaccine and those circulating in the community. If the viruses in the vaccine and the influenza viruses circulating in the community are closely matched, vaccine effectiveness is higher. If they are not closely matched, vaccine effectiveness can be reduced. However, it�s important to remember that even when the viruses are not closely matched, the vaccine can still protect many people and prevent flu-related complications. Such protection is possible because antibodies made in response to the vaccine can provide some protection (called cross-protection) against different, but related strains of influenza viruses. The vaccine may be somewhat less effective in elderly persons and very young children, but vaccination can still prevent serious complications from the flu.","The vaccine may be somewhat less effective in elderly persons and very young children, but vaccination can still prevent serious complications from the flu.","However, it�s important to remember that even when the viruses are not closely matched, the vaccine can still protect many people and prevent flu-related complications.","However, it s important to remember that even when the viruses are not closely matched, the vaccine can still protect many people and prevent flu-related complications.","The ability of flu vaccine to protect a person depends on two things.

2008-2009,Why were two vaccines needed last season?,"The 2009-2010 season was very unusual. The emergence of a new and very different H1N1 virus meant that two vaccines were needed: one to prevent seasonal influenza viruses that were anticipated to spread and another to prevent influenza caused by the newly emerged 2009 H1N1 virus. As usual, components of the seasonal flu vaccine were decided upon well in advance of the season and vaccine production was well underway by the time the new 2009 H1N1 virus emerged. If the 2009 H1N1 virus had emerged sooner, it would have been included in the seasonal vaccine. Therefore, a second flu vaccine was created to protect against the new flu virus. 2009 H1N1 was by far the dominant virus in circulation last season, and the 2009 H1N1 vaccine was a very good match; 99.5% of the 2009 H1N1 virus specimens tested during the season were related to the virus used to develop the 2009 H1N1 vaccine.\nThe 2010-2011 seasonal flu vaccine will protect against the 2009 H1N1 virus and 2 other flu viruses.","2009 H1N1 was by far the dominant virus in circulation last season, and the 2009 H1N1 vaccine was a very good match; 99.5% of the 2009 H1N1 virus specimens tested during the season were related to the virus used to develop the 2009 H1N1 vaccine.\nThe 2010-2011 seasonal flu vaccine will protect against the 2009 H1N1 virus and 2 other flu viruses.","As usual, components of the seasonal flu vaccine were decided upon well in advance of the season and vaccine production was well underway by the time the new 2009 H1N1 virus emerged.","2009 H1N1 was by far the dominant virus in circulation last season, and the 2009 H1N1 vaccine was a very good match; 99.5% of the 2009 H1N1 virus specimens tested during the season were related to the virus used to develop the 2009 H1N1 vaccine.nThe 2010-2011 seasonal flu vaccine will protect against the 2009 H1N1 virus and 2 other flu viruses.",The 2009-2010 season was very unusual.

2008-2009,What did CDC do to monitor antiviral resistance in the United States during the 2009-10 season?,"Antiviral resistance means that a virus has changed in such a way that antiviral drugs have become less effective in treating or preventing illnesses caused by the virus. Samples of viruses collected from around the United States and the world are studied to determine if they are resistant to any of the four FDA-approved influenza antiviral drugs.\nCDC routinely collects viruses through a domestic and global surveillance system to monitor for changes in influenza viruses. CDC conducted surveillance and testing of seasonal influenza viruses and 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses to check for antiviral resistance. CDC also implemented enhanced surveillance across the United States to monitor resistance in 2009 H1N1 viruses. By the end of the 2009-2010 season, almost all (98.9%) of the 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses tested for antiviral resistance at CDC were susceptible to oseltamivir (Tamiflu�), and all of the viruses tested were susceptible to zanamivir (Relenza�).

2010-2011,How effective is the seasonal flu vaccine?,"The effectiveness of the seasonal flu vaccine can vary from year to year and among different age and risk groups. In general, the highest vaccine effectiveness is seen among young healthy adults and older children. Lower vaccine effectiveness is reported for young children (e.g., those younger than 2 years of age), and older adults with only one randomized trial conducted in adults 60 years and older. Vaccine effectiveness also depends on the degree to which influenza vaccine viruses are well matched to circulating influenza viruses. Lower effectiveness is expected in years when the match between circulating and vaccine viruses are suboptimal.

This is the first time since CDC started this kind of ILI surveillance that the percentage of patient visits for ILI was elevated for only one week of the season. In past seasons, ILI has remained above baseline for between 8 and 20 weeks, with an average of 13 weeks at or above baseline each season since this type of surveillance began in 1997-1998.

Efforts are underway to improve influenza vaccines. The public health community and the federal government are investing in and supporting the development of new and improved influenza vaccines. (For more information on new vaccine research initiatives, contact HHS Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). In the meantime, influenza vaccine is the best tool we have to protect as many people as possible against influenza.",The public health community and the federal government are investing in and supporting the development of new and improved influenza vaccines.,The public health community and the federal government are investing in and supporting the development of new and improved influenza vaccines.,The public health community and the federal government are investing in and supporting the development of new and improved influenza vaccines.,The current influenza vaccine is recommended because it is the best way to prevent influenza infections.

2011-2012,What factors influence flu vaccine effectiveness?,"How well the flu vaccine works (or its ability to prevent influenza illness) can range widely from season to season and also can vary depending on who is being vaccinated. At least two factors play an important role in determining the likelihood that influenza vaccine will protect a person from influenza illness: 1) characteristics of the person being vaccinated (such as their age and health), and 2) the similarity or �match� between the influenza viruses in the vaccine and those spreading in the community. During years when the viruses in the vaccine and circulating viruses are not well matched, it�s possible that no benefit from vaccination may be observed. During years when the viruses in the vaccine and circulating viruses are very well matched, it�s possible to measure substantial benefits from vaccination in terms of preventing influenza illness. However, even during years when the vaccine match is very good, the benefits of vaccination will vary across the population, depending on characteristics of the person being vaccinated and even, potentially, which vaccine was used.\nResearchers try to determine how well a vaccine works in order to continually assess and confirm the value of influenza vaccines as a public health intervention. Study results about how well a flu vaccine works can vary based on study design, outcome(s) measured, population studied and the season in which the vaccine was studied. These differences can make it difficult to compare one study�s results with another�s.\nWhile determining how well a flu vaccine works is challenging, in general, recent studies have supported the conclusion that influenza vaccination benefits public health, especially when the viruses in the vaccine and circulating viruses are well-matched.","These differences can make it difficult to compare one study�s results with another�s.\nWhile determining how well a flu vaccine works is challenging, in general, recent studies have supported the conclusion that influenza vaccination benefits public health, especially when the viruses in the vaccine and circulating viruses are well-matched.","These differences can make it difficult to compare one study�s results with another�s.\nWhile determining how well a flu vaccine works is challenging, in general, recent studies have supported the conclusion that influenza vaccination benefits public health, especially when the viruses in the vaccine and circulating viruses are well-matched.","During years when the viruses in the vaccine and circulating viruses are very well matched, it s possible to measure substantial benefits from vaccination in terms of preventing influenza illness.",How well the flu vaccine works can range widely from season to season.

2011-2012,What did CDC do to monitor effectiveness of flu vaccines for the 2011-2012 season?,"Scientists continued to work on better ways to design, conduct and evaluate non-randomized (i.e., observational) studies to assess how well flu vaccines work. CDC has been working with researchers at universities and hospitals since the 2003-2004 influenza season to estimate how well influenza vaccine works through observational studies using laboratory-confirmed influenza as the outcome. These studies currently use laboratory-confirmed medically-attended influenza virus infections as a specific outcome. CDC�s studies are conducted in five sites across the United States to gather more representative data. To assess how well the vaccine works across different age groups, CDC�s studies of vaccine effects have included all people aged 6 months and older recommended at that time for an annual influenza vaccination. Similar studies are being done in Australia, Canada and Europe.","Similar studies are being done in Australia, Canada and Europe.",CDC has been working with researchers at universities and hospitals since the 2003-2004 influenza season to estimate how well influenza vaccine works through observational studies using laboratory-confirmed influenza as the outcome.,CDC has been working with researchers at universities and hospitals since the 2003-2004 influenza season to estimate how well influenza vaccine works through observational studies using laboratory-confirmed influenza as the outcome.,"CDC has been working with researchers at universities and hospitals since the 2003-2004 influenza season.

2011-2012,What did CDC do to monitor antiviral resistance in the United States during the 2011-12 season?,"Antiviral resistance means that a virus has changed in such a way that antiviral drugs have become less effective in treating or preventing illnesses caused by the virus. Samples of viruses collected from around the United States and the world are studied to determine if they are resistant to any of the four Food and Drug Administration-approved influenza antiviral drugs.\nCDC routinely collects viruses through a domestic and global surveillance system to monitor for changes in influenza viruses. CDC conducted surveillance and testing of influenza viruses to check for antiviral resistance. CDC also worked with the state public health departments and the World Health Organization to collect additional information on antiviral resistance in the United States and worldwide. The information collected assisted in making informed public health policy recommendations.\nBy the end of the 2011-2012 season, almost all (98.6%) of the 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses tested for antiviral resistance at CDC were susceptible to oseltamivir (Tamiflu�), and all 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses tested were susceptible to zanamivir (Relenza �). One hundred percent of the H3N2 viruses tested were susceptible to oseltamivir and zanamivir.

2011-2012,Were infections with unusual influenza viruses detected in 2011-2012?,"Yes. Thirteen cases of human infection with a novel influenza A (H3N2) variant (H3N2v) virus were reported to CDC. These H3N2v viruses had the M gene from the pH1N1 virus, and are associated with exposure to swine. The thirteen cases were identified in six states: Indiana (two cases), Iowa (three), Maine (two), Pennsylvania (three), Utah (one), and West Virginia (two). One of the 13 cases occurred in an adult, and 12 occurred in children. Three cases resulted in hospitalization; all three patients have recovered fully from their illness. Six of the 13 cases were in persons who reported no recent exposure to swine. In addition, two other novel viruses were identified during the 2011�12 season: one case of influenza A (H1N2) variant (H1N2v) was identified in Minnesota, and one case of influenza A (H1N1) variant (H1N1v) was identified in Wisconsin. One case was in a person who reported close contact with swine preceding symptom onset; both patients are fully recovered.\nSince July 2012, there have been outbreaks of H3N2 variant viruses with the matrix (M) gene from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus in multiple U.S. states.

2013-2014,Who was most severely impacted by flu this season?,"During the 2013-2014 season, CDC received reports of severe flu illness among young and middle-aged adults, many of whom were infected with the 2009 H1N1 virus. Nearly 60% of the flu-associated hospitalizations reported to CDC�s influenza surveillance system were in people 18 to 64 years old. A similar increase in hospitalizations among non-elderly adults was also seen during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. These severe flu outcomes are a reminder that flu can be a very serious disease for anyone, including young, previously healthy adults.\nHospitalization rates were also affected. While rates were still highest among people 65 and older, people 50 to 64 years had the second-highest hospitalization rate. Hospitalization rates among those aged 50 to 64 years were higher than those seen during the 2009 pandemic and in any year since. These indicators underscore the impact that seasonal flu had in the United States, particularly on people less than 65 years of age.","These indicators underscore the impact that seasonal flu had in the United States, particularly on people less than 65 years of age.",Hospitalization rates among those aged 50 to 64 years were higher than those seen during the 2009 pandemic and in any year since.,Hospitalization rates among those aged 50 to 64 years were higher than those seen during the 2009 pandemic and in any year since.,"During the 2013-2014 season, CDC received reports of severe flu illness among young and middle-aged adults, many of whom were infected with the 2009 H1N1 virus.

2014-2015,How many people died from flu during the 2014-2015 season?,"CDC does not count how many people die from flu each year. Unlike flu deaths in children, flu deaths in adults are not nationally reportable. However, CDC has two flu surveillance systems that are used to monitor relative levels of flu-associated deaths. One is the 122 Cities Mortality Reporting System and the other is mortality data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. Both of these systems track the proportion of death certificates processed that list pneumonia or influenza as the underlying or contributing cause of death of the total deaths reported. These systems provide an overall indication of whether flu-associated deaths are elevated, but do not provide an exact number of how many people died from flu. For more information, see Overview of Influenza Surveillance in the United States.\nCDC also uses modeling studies to estimate numbers of flu-related deaths, but these studies apply only to past seasons and are not done each year.

2014-2015,Were there new recommendations for the 2014-2015 influenza season?,"Recommendations on the control and prevention of influenza are published annually, in late summer or early fall. Recommendations for the 2014-2015 season are available in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) Prevention and Control of Seasonal Influenza with Vaccines: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) � United States, 2014-15 Influenza Season. During the 2014-2015 flu season, CDC recommended use of the nasal spray vaccine (LAIV) for healthy* children 2 through 8 years of age, when it was immediately available and if the child had no contraindications or precautions to that vaccine. For more information, see Nasal Spray Flu Vaccine in Children 2 through 8 Years Old or the 2014-2015 MMWR Influenza Vaccine Recommendations. However, on February 26, 2015, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) did not renew the preferential recommendation for LAIV for the 2015-2016 season.

2014-2015,What flu viruses did the 2014-2015 flu vaccines protect against?,"Flu vaccines are designed to protect against the main flu viruses that research suggests will be the most common during the upcoming season. Three kinds of flu viruses commonly circulate among people today: influenza A (H1N1) viruses, influenza A (H3N2) viruses, and influenza B viruses. Each year, reference viruses are used to produce seasonal influenza vaccine.\nAll of the 2014-2015 influenza vaccine was made to protect against:\nan A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus\nan A/Texas/50/2012 (H3N2)-like virus\na B/Massachusetts/2/2012-like virus.\nSome of the 2014-2015 flu vaccine was quadrivalent vaccine.

2014-2015,Why didn�t the 2014-2015 season vaccine contain the right H3N2 virus?,"Experts must pick which viruses to include in the vaccine many months in advance of the flu season in order for vaccine to be produced and delivered on time. And flu viruses change constantly; they can change from one season to the next or they can even change within the course of one flu season. Because of these factors, there is always the possibility of a less than optimal match between circulating viruses and the viruses in the vaccine.\nWhen the vaccine viruses for 2014-2015 were selected, A/Texas/50/2012 was the most common circulating influenza A (H3N2) virus, so it was chosen to be included in the vaccine. The drifted influenza A (H3N2) viruses that circulated during the 2014-2015 season were first detected during routine surveillance testing in late March 2014, after World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for the vaccine composition for the Northern Hemisphere formulation of the 2014-2015 vaccine were made (in mid-February). At that time, only a very small number of these viruses had been found among the thousands of specimens that had been collected and tested and there was no way to predict that they would circulate widely.","At that time, only a very small number of these viruses had been found among the thousands of specimens that had been collected and tested and there was no way to predict that they would circulate widely.","The drifted influenza A (H3N2) viruses that circulated during the 2014-2015 season were first detected during routine surveillance testing in late March 2014, after World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for the vaccine composition for the Northern Hemisphere formulation of the 2014-2015 vaccine were made (in mid-February).","Because of these factors, there is always the possibility of a less than optimal match between circulating viruses and the viruses in the vaccine.nWhen the vaccine viruses for 2014-2015 were selected, A/Texas/50/2012 was the most common circulating influenza A (H3N2) virus, so it was chosen to be included in the vaccine.",Experts must pick which viruses to include in the vaccine many months in advance of the flu season.

2015-2016,What was the 2015-2016 flu season like?,"Flu seasons can vary in their timing, severity, and duration from one season to another. The 2015-2016 flu season started a little later than the previous three flu seasons. The season also peaked later. While H3N2 viruses predominated early in the season, H1N1 viruses were the most common later in the season and were the predominant virus for the entire season. This is the virus that emerged in 2009 to cause a pandemic and that caused severe illness in some children & young-and middle-aged adults. While there were reports of severe flu illnesses and deaths, overall the 2015-2016 season was milder than the previous three seasons.","While there were reports of severe flu illnesses and deaths, overall the 2015-2016 season was milder than the previous three seasons.","While there were reports of severe flu illnesses and deaths, overall the 2015-2016 season was milder than the previous three seasons.","While there were reports of severe flu illnesses and deaths, overall the 2015-2016 season was milder than the previous three seasons.",The 2015-2016 flu season started a little later than the previous three flu seasons.

2015-2016,When did the 2015-2016 flu season peak?,"The timing of flu is unpredictable and can vary in different parts of the country and from season to season. Most of the timeflu activitypeaks between December and February, although activity can last as late as May. The peak week of flu activity in terms of influenza-like illness (ILI) for the 2015-2016 season was the week ending March 12, 2016. This is one of the later season peaks on record. Over the last 18 seasons (including the 2015-2016 season), only three seasons have peaked during March (2015-2016, 2011-2012 and 2005-2006).

2015-2016,How many people died from flu during the 2015-2016 season?,"CDC does not count how many people die from flu each year. Unlike flu deaths in children, flu deaths in adults are not nationally reportable. During the 2015-2016 season, overall influenza activity was moderate, with a lower percentage of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI), lower hospitalization rates, and a lower percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza (P&I) compared with the preceding three seasons (2012-2013, 2013-2014, and 2014-2015). CDC usedtwo flu surveillance systemsto monitor relative levels of flu-associated deaths: mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics and the 122 Cities Mortality Reporting System. Both of these systems track the proportion of death certificates processed that list pneumonia or influenza as the underlying or contributing cause of death of the total deaths reported. These systems provide an overall indication of whether flu-associated deaths are elevated, but do not provide an exact number of how many people died from flu. Based on data from CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics Mortality Surveillance System, the proportion of deaths attributed to P&I was at or slightly above the epidemic threshold for three consecutive weeks from the week ending January 2, 2016, through the week ending January 16, 2016 (weeks 52-2) and again for four consecutive weeks from the week ending February 27, 2016, through the week ending March 19, 2016 (weeks 8-11). The percentage of deaths attributed to P&I peaked at 7.9% during the week ending March 19, 2016 (week 11). During the past five influenza seasons, peak weekly percentages of deaths attributable to P&I have ranged from 8.7% during the 2011-12 season to 11.1% during the 2012-13 season. Based on 122 Cities Mortality Reporting System data, the weekly percentage of deaths attributed to P&I exceeded the epidemic threshold for the weeks ending January 16, 2016 (week 2) and February 27, 2016 (week 8), and again for 5 consecutive weeks from the week ending March 19, 2016, through the week ending April 16, 2016 (weeks 11–15), and finally, for 2 consecutive weeks from the week ending May 7, 2016, through the week ending May 14, 2016 (weeks 18–19). P&I mortality peaked at 7.8% during the week ending March 26, 2016 (week 12).

CDC’s adjusted overall VE estimate against influenza A and B viruses for all ages was 47%. The overall VE against A(H1N1)pdm09 was 41% and the overall VE against influenza B was 55%. This data is consistent with VE observed during previous seasons when vaccine viruses and circulating viruses were similar. These vaccine effectiveness estimates were derived from data collected from the U.S. Flu VE Network from November 2, 2015, through April 15, 2016.

2015-2016,Did CDC do anything different in terms of virologic surveillance during the 2015-2016 season?,"Yes. In advance of the 2015-2016 season, CDC and the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) shared revised guidelines with public health laboratories for submitting influenza viruses to CDC for testing. The revised guidelines set the recommended number of flu viruses of each type and subtype to be submitted to CDC by each laboratory, along with when and how those viruses should be submitted. The revisions were implemented with the goal of yielding a more balanced and comprehensive picture of antigenic, genetic, and antiviral properties of the main groups of flu viruses circulating in the United States. During past seasons, the viruses that have been submitted to CDC have not been fully representative of the main circulating flu viruses (A(H1N1)pdm09, H3N2, and B); specifically, predominantly circulating viruses have often been over-represented among submitted samples. It is important to have equally strong surveillance data for the main groups of circulating flu viruses since this data is needed to inform vaccine virus selection and different viruses can predominate from season to season. Top of Page",Yes.,"During past seasons, the viruses that have been submitted to CDC have not been fully representative of the main circulating flu viruses (A(H1N1)pdm09, H3N2, and B); specifically, predominantly circulating viruses have often been over-represented among submitted samples.","During past seasons, the viruses that have been submitted to CDC have not been fully representative of the main circulating flu viruses (A(H1N1)pdm09, H3N2, and B); specifically, predominantly circulating viruses have often been over-represented among submitted samples.","In advance of the 2015-2016 season, CDC and the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) shared revised guidelines with public health laboratories.

2016-2017,Flu Activity,"As of a flu activity update published in theMorbidity and Mortality Weekly Report on February 17, 2017, flu activity during the 2016-2017 season had been moderate, with influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominating and severity indicators within the range of what has been seen during previous seasons that were H3N2-predominant. H3N2-predominant seasons have been associated with more severe illness and mortality, especially in older people and young children, relative to seasons during which H1N1 or B viruses predominated. Flu viruses are constantly changing so it’s not unusual for new flu viruses to appear each year. However, as of theFebruary 2017 MMWR, most of the influenza viruses analyzed this season have remained like the vaccine viruses recommended for production of Northern Hemisphere vaccines. For more information about how flu viruses change, visitHow the Flu Virus Can Change. The United States experiences epidemics of seasonal flu each year. This time of year is called “flu season.” In the United States, flu viruses are most common during the fall and winter months. Influenza activity often begins to increase in October and November. Most of the time flu activity peaks between December and March and can last as late as May. CDC monitors certain key flu indicators (for example, outpatient visits of influenza-like illness (ILI), the results of laboratory testing and flu hospitalization and deaths). When these indicators rise and remain elevated for a number of consecutive weeks, flu season is said to have begun. Usually ILI increases first, followed by an increase in flu-associated hospitalizations, which is then followed by increases in flu-associated deaths. During 2016-2017, influenza-like-illness (ILI) went above baseline the week endingDecember 17, 2016. For the most current influenza surveillance information, please see FluView atWeekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report. The timing of flu is very unpredictable and can vary in different parts of the country and from season to season. Seasonal flu viruses can be detected year-round; however, seasonal flu activity can begin as early as October and continue to occur as late as May. Flu activity most commonly peaks in the United States between December and March. For the 2016-2017 season, influenza-like-illness (ILI) in the United States went above baseline the week ending December 17, 2016 and remained elevated as of mid-March. The season has likely peaked. CDC does not count how many people die from flu each year. Unlike flu deaths in children, flu deaths in adults are not nationally reportable. However, CDC uses mortality data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics to monitor relative levels of flu-associated deaths. This system tracks the proportion of death certificates processed that list pneumonia or influenza as the underlying or contributing cause of death of the total deaths reported. This system provides an overall indication of whether flu-associated deaths are elevated, but does not provide an exact number of how many people died from flu. For more information, seeOverview of Influenza Surveillance in the United States, “Mortality Surveillance.” CDC also uses modeling studies to estimate numbers of flu-related deaths, but these studies apply only to past seasons and are not done each year. For more information, seeEstimating Seasonal Influenza-Associated Deaths in the United States. There are several factors that make it difficult to determine accurate numbers of deaths caused by flu regardless of reporting. Some of the challenges in counting influenza-associated deaths include the following: the sheer volume of deaths to be counted; the lack of testing (not everyone that dies with an influenza-like illness is tested for influenza); and the different coding of deaths (influenza-associated deaths are often a result of complications secondary to underlying medical problems, and this may be difficult to sort out).

2016-2017,Protective Actions,"CDC recommends a yearlyflu vaccinefor everyone 6 months of age and older as the first and most important step in protecting against this serious disease. In addition to getting a seasonal flu vaccine, you can takeeveryday preventive actionslike staying away from sick people and washing your hands to reduce the spread of germs. If you are sick with flu, stay home from work or school to prevent spreading flu to others. In addition, there are prescription medications called antiviral drugs that can be used to treat influenza illness. VisitWhat you Should Know About Flu Antiviral Drugsfor more information. Encourage your loved ones to get vaccinated. Vaccination is especially important forpeople at high risk for developing flu-related complications, and their close contacts. Also, if you have a loved one who is at high risk of flu complications and they develop flu symptoms, encourage them to get a medical evaluation for possible treatment with flu antiviral drugs. CDC recommends that people who are at high risk for serious flu complications who get flu symptoms during flu season be treated with flu antiviral drugs as quickly as possible. People who are not at high risk for serious flu complications may also be treated with antiviral drugs, especially if treatment can begin within 48 hours. Some children 6 months through 8 years of age will require two doses of flu vaccine for adequate protection from flu. Children in this age group who are getting vaccinated for the first time will need two doses of flu vaccine, spaced at least 28 days apart. Some children who have received flu vaccine previously and children who have only received one dose in their lifetime also may need two doses. Your child’s doctor or other health care professional can tell you if your child needs two doses. VisitChildren, the Flu, and the Flu Vaccinefor more information. Children younger than 6 months are at higher risk of serious flu complications, but are too young to get a flu vaccine. Because of this, safeguarding them from flu is especially important. If you live with or care for an infant younger than 6 months of age, you should get a flu vaccine to help protect them from flu.Advice for Caregivers of Young Childrenhas more information.

2016-2017,If You Get Sick,"Antiviral drugs are prescription drugs that can be used to treat flu illness. People athigh riskof serious flucomplications(such as children younger than 5 years, adults 65 years of age and older, pregnant women, people with certain medical conditions, and residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities) and people who are very sick with flu (such as those hospitalized because of flu) should get treatment with antiviral drugs as early as possible after illness begins. Some other people may be treated with antivirals at their health care professional’s discretion. Treating high risk people or people who are very sick with flu with antiviral drugs is very important. Studies show that prompt treatment, especially within 2 days of illness onset, with antiviral drugs can prevent serious flu complications. Prompt treatment can mean the difference between having a milder illness versus very serious illness that could result in a hospital stay. Treatment with antivirals works best when begun within 48 hours of getting sick, but can still be beneficial when given later in the course of illness. Antiviral drugs are effective across all age and risk groups. Studies show that antiviral drugs are under-prescribed for people who are at high risk of complications who get flu. Three FDA-approved antiviral medications are recommended for use during the 2016-2017 flu season: oseltamivir (available as a generic version or under the trade name Tamiflu®), zanamivir (trade name Relenza®), and peramivir (trade name Rapivab®). More information about antiviral drugs can be found atTreatment – Antiviral Drugs. More information available: “The Flu: What To Do If You Get Sick” In August 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first generic version of Tamiflu® (oseltamivir phosphate).

2016-2017,Surveillance,"The Epidemiology and Prevention Branch in the Influenza Division at CDC collects, compiles and analyzes information on flu activity year round in the United States and produces FluView, a weekly influenza surveillance report, and FluView Interactive, which allows for more in-depth exploration of flu surveillance data. The U.S. influenza surveillance system is a collaborative effort between CDC and its many partners in state, local, and territorial health departments, public health and clinical laboratories, vital statistics offices, health care providers, clinics, and emergency departments. Information in five categories is collected from eight different data sources that allow CDC to: For more information, visit “Overview of Influenza Surveillance in the United States”. Yes. A new FluView interactive application was introduced over the summer of 2016 that shows the distribution by age group of flu-positive tests by flu virus type and subtype or lineage. This application allows users to view laboratory data from multiple seasons and different age groups. Users also can view the chart data by week or cumulatively for the season. The new FluView application shows the distribution by age group of flu-positive specimens from the 1997-1998 flu season through the current week of reporting. Influenza B lineage information is available starting from the 2015-16 season. It’s important to note, however, that because testing practices and the number of participating public health laboratories can change from year to year; it is not always appropriate to determine the relative severity of flu seasons by comparing the number of positive specimens across seasons. CDC collaborates with other partners each season to assess how well the seasonal vaccines are working. During the 2016-2017 season, CDC is planning multiple studies on theeffectiveness of flu shots. These studies measure vaccine effectiveness in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza among persons 6 months of age and older. A summary of CDC’s latest vaccine effectiveness estimates is available atSeasonal Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness, 2005-2016. CDC will continue to collect and monitor flu viruses for changes through an established network of domestic and global surveillance systems. CDC also is working with the state public health departments and the World Health Organization to collect additional information on antiviral resistance in the United States and worldwide. The information collected will assist in making informed recommendations regarding use of antiviral drugs to treat influenza.",The information collected will assist in making informed recommendations regarding use of antiviral drugs to treat influenza.,"The Epidemiology and Prevention Branch in the Influenza Division at CDC collects, compiles and analyzes information on flu activity year round in the United States and produces FluView, a weekly influenza surveillance report, and FluView Interactive, which allows for more in-depth exploration of flu surveillance data.

2016-2017,Flu and Parotitis,"Acute parotitis is recent swelling of one of the salivary glands. It can be caused by a number of things, including viruses and bacteria. Acute viral parotitis is not a common symptom of flu virus infection and is much more commonly seen following infection with the mumps virus. We don’t know exactly how commonly parotitis occurs with flu. Prior to 2014, roughly a dozen cases were reported in the scientific literature. However, during the 2014–2015 flu season in the United States, several hundred cases were reported to CDC, representing the largest number of reported cases ever. Parotitis after flu appears to occur in people of all ages but mostly in school-aged children and more commonly in males. While still rare, flu-associated parotitis appears to occur more often after infection with influenza A (H3N2) viruses. If you think you have swollen salivary glands, you should see your health care provider as this may be due to a blockage or may be a symptom of an infection, like mumps or flu, which could spread to others. Your health care provider may test you for an infection and tell you to stay home, or self-isolate, until the swelling has gone done or your symptoms have resolved. Depending on the cause of the swelling, treatment may be recommended.",Parotitis after flu appears to occur in people of all ages but mostly in school-aged children and more commonly in males.,"Acute viral parotitis is not a common symptom of flu virus infection and is much more commonly seen following infection with the mumps virus.

2017-2018,How many people died from flu during the 2017-2018 season?,"While flu deaths in children are reported to CDC, flu deaths in adults are not nationally notifiable. In order to monitor influenza related deaths in all age groups, CDC tracks pneumonia and influenza (P&I)-attributed deaths through the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Mortality Reporting System. This system tracks the proportion of death certificates processed that list pneumonia or influenza as the underlying or contributing cause of death. This system provides an overall indication of whether flu-associated deaths are elevated, but does not provide an exact number of how many people died from flu. During the 2017-2018 season, the percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza (P&I) was at or above the epidemic threshold for 16 consecutive weeks. During the past five seasons, the average number of weeks this indicator was above threshold was 11 (range of 7 to 15 weeks). Nationally, mortality attributed to P&I exceeded 10.0% for four consecutive weeks, peaking at 10.8% during the week ending January 20, 2018. As it does for the numbers of flu cases, doctor’s visits and hospitalizations, CDC also estimates deaths in the United States using mathematical modeling. CDC estimates that from 2010-2011 to 2013-2014, influenza-associated deaths in the United States ranged from a low of 12,000 (during 2011-2012) to a high of 56,000 (during 2012-2013). Death certificate data and weekly influenza virus surveillance information was used to estimate how many flu-related deaths occurred among people whose underlying cause of death on their death certificate included respiratory or circulatory causes.

2017-2018,How many children died from flu during the 2017-2018 season?,"As of April 19, 2019, a total of 186 pediatric deaths had been reported to CDC during the 2017-2018 season. This number exceeds the previously highest number of flu-associated deaths in children reported during a regular flu season (171 during the 2012-2013 season). Approximately 80% of these deaths occurred in children who had not received a flu vaccination this season. For the most recent data and more information visitFluView: Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality. Since flu-associated deaths in children became a nationally notifiable condition in 2004, the total number of flu-associated deaths among children during one season has ranged from 37 (during the 2011-2012 season) to 186 (during the 2017-18 season, as of April 19, 2019); this excludes the 2009 pandemic, when 358 pediatric deaths from April 15, 2009 through October 2, 2010 were reported to CDC.","Since flu-associated deaths in children became a nationally notifiable condition in 2004, the total number of flu-associated deaths among children during one season has ranged from 37 (during the 2011-2012 season) to 186 (during the 2017-18 season, as of April 19, 2019); this excludes the 2009 pandemic, when 358 pediatric deaths from April 15, 2009 through October 2, 2010 were reported to CDC.","Since flu-associated deaths in children became a nationally notifiable condition in 2004, the total number of flu-associated deaths among children during one season has ranged from 37 (during the 2011-2012 season) to 186 (during the 2017-18 season, as of April 19, 2019); this excludes the 2009 pandemic, when 358 pediatric deaths from April 15, 2009 through October 2, 2010 were reported to CDC.","Since flu-associated deaths in children became a nationally notifiable condition in 2004, the total number of flu-associated deaths among children during one season has ranged from 37 (during the 2011-2012 season) to 186 (during the 2017-18 season, as of April 19, 2019); this excludes the 2009 pandemic, when 358 pediatric deaths from April 15, 2009 through October 2, 2010 were reported to CDC.","As of April 19, 2019, a total of 186 pediatric deaths had been reported to CDC.

2017-2018,How effective was the 2017-2018 flu vaccine?,"The overall vaccine effectiveness (VE) of the 2017-2018 flu vaccine against both influenza A and B viruses is estimated to be 40%. This means the flu vaccine reduced a person’s overall risk of having to seek medical care at a doctor’s office for flu illness by 40%. Protection by virus type and subtype was: 25% against A(H3N2), 65% against A(H1N1) and 49% against influenza B viruses. These VE estimates were presented to theAdvisory Committee on Immunization Practices on June 20, 2018. While flu vaccine can vary in how well it works, flu vaccination is the best way to prevent flu and its potentially serious complications and prevents millions of flu illnesses and related doctors’ visits and tens of thousands of hospitalizations. For example, during the 2016–2017 influenza season, CDC estimates that flu vaccine prevented an estimated 5.3 million illnesses, 2.6 million medical visits, and 85,000 hospitalizations associated with influenza. Similar estimates for 2017-2018 will be released in fall 2018. Influenza vaccination also has been shown to reduce the risk of flu death in children. For more information about previous vaccine effectiveness, visitHow Well Does the Seasonal Flu Vaccine Work?.",Influenza vaccination also has been shown to reduce the risk of flu death in children.,The overall vaccine effectiveness (VE) of the 2017-2018 flu vaccine against both influenza A and B viruses is estimated to be 40%.,The overall vaccine effectiveness (VE) of the 2017-2018 flu vaccine against both influenza A and B viruses is estimated to be 40%.,"The overall vaccine effectiveness (VE) of the 2017-2018 flu vaccine against both influenza A and B viruses is estimated to be 40%.

2018-2019,What’s new this flu season?,"A few things are new this season: For the 2018-2019 flu season, providers may choose to administer any licensed, age-appropriate flu vaccine (IIV, RIV4, or LAIV4). Options this season include: There is a table showing all flu vaccines that are FDA-approved for use in the United States during the 2018-2019 season. There are many different flu viruses and they are constantly changing. The composition of U.S. flu vaccines is reviewed annually and updated as needed to match circulating flu viruses. Flu vaccines protect against the three or four viruses (depending on vaccine) that research suggests will be most common. For 2018-2019, trivalent (three-component) vaccines are recommended to contain: Quadrivalent (four-component) vaccines, which protect against a second lineage of B viruses, are recommended to contain: You should get a flu vaccine before flu begins spreading in your community. It takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies that protect against flu to develop in the body, so make plans to get vaccinated early in fall, before flu season begins. CDC recommends that people get a flu vaccine by the end of October. Getting vaccinated later, however, can still be beneficial and vaccination should continue to be offered throughout flu season, even into January or later. Children who need two doses of vaccine to be protected should start the vaccination process sooner, because the two doses must be given at least four weeks apart. The recommendations for people with egg allergies are the same as last season. Cell-grown reference viruses do not have the changes that are present in egg-grown reference viruses, so they should be more similar to circulating “wild-type” viruses. Vaccine effectiveness depends in part on the match between the vaccine virus and circulating flu viruses. While the use of cell-grown reference viruses and cell-based technology may offer the potential for better protection over traditional, egg-based flu vaccines because they result in vaccine viruses that are more similar to flu viruses in circulation, there are no data yet to support this. There is no preferential recommendation for one injectable flu vaccine over another. It is not possible to predict what this flu season will be like. While flu spreads every year, the timing, severity, and length of the season varies from one season to another. Flu viruses are constantly changing so it’s not unusual for new flu viruses to appear each year. More information about how flu viruses change is available. The United States experiences annual epidemics of seasonal flu. This time of year is called “flu season.” In the United States, flu viruses are most common during the fall and winter months. Influenza activity often begins to increase in October and November. Most of the time flu activity peaks between December and February, and it can last as late as May. CDC monitors certain key flu indicators (for example, outpatient visits of influenza-like illness (ILI), the results of laboratory testing and reports of flu hospitalizations and deaths). When these indicators rise and remain elevated for a number of consecutive weeks, “flu season” is said to have begun. Usually ILI increases first, followed by an increase in flu-associated hospitalizations, which is then followed by increases in flu-associated deaths. For the most current influenza surveillance information: Weekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report. The timing of flu is unpredictable and can vary in different parts of the country and from season to season. Seasonal flu viruses can be detected year-round; however, seasonal flu activity often begins as early as October and November and can continue to occur as late as May. Flu activity most commonly peaks in the United States between December and February. CDC conducts surveillance for people who see their health care provider for flu-like illness through the Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet); a network of thousands of health care providers who report the proportion of patients seeking care for flu-like illness weekly to CDC. This system allows CDC to track levels of medically attended flu-like illness over the course of the flu season. CDC does not know exactly how many people get sick with seasonal flu each year. There are several reasons for this including that ILINet does not include every health care provider and monitors flu-like illness, not laboratory-confirmed influenza cases. Also, flu illness is not a reportable disease and not everyone who gets sick with flu seeks medical care or gets tested. CDC uses mathematical modeling in combination with data from traditional flu surveillance systems to estimate the numbers of flu illnesses in the United States. CDC estimates that flu has resulted in between 9.3 million and 49 million illnesses each year in the United States since 2010. More information on these estimates is available on CDC’s Disease Burden of Influenza page. During the 2018-2019 flu season, CDC began reporting cumulative, in-season estimates of the disease burden of influenza, including estimates of the total number of flu illnesses in the United States. More information regarding these Preliminary In-Season Burden Estimates is available. For more information on CDC surveillance systems, see CDC’s Overview of Influenza Surveillance in the United States. CDC conducts surveillance for flu-related hospitalizations through the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET), a collaboration between CDC, the Emerging Infections Program, and additional Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Project (IHSP) states in 13 geographically distributed areas in the United States. The network includes hospitals that serve roughly 9 percent of the U.S. population. The data collected through FluSurv-NET allows CDC to calculate an overall hospitalization rate, as well as by age group, but this system does not provide the total number of flu hospitalizations that actually occur in the United States. Reported FluSurv-NET hospitalization rates are adjusted to correct for under-detection, which is calculated from the percent of persons hospitalized with respiratory illness who were tested for influenza and the average sensitivity of influenza tests used in the participating FluSurv-NET surveillance hospitals. CDC uses these methods to estimate the true burden of flu hospitalizations in the United States. Since 2010, CDC estimates that flu has resulted in between 140,000 and 960,000 hospitalizations each year. For more information on these estimates see CDC’s Disease Burden of Influenza page. During the 2018-2019 flu season, CDC began reporting cumulative, in-season estimates of disease burden of influenza, including estimates of the total number of people hospitalized in the United States from flu. More information regarding these Preliminary In-Season Burden Estimates is available. For more information on CDC surveillance systems, see CDC’s Overview of Influenza Surveillance in the United States. Flu deaths in adults are not nationally notifiable. In order to monitor influenza related deaths in all age groups, CDC tracks pneumonia and influenza (P&I)–attributed deaths through the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Mortality Reporting System. This system tracks the proportion of death certificates processed that list pneumonia or influenza as the underlying or contributing cause of death. This system provides an overall indication of whether flu-associated deaths are elevated, but does not provide an exact number of how many people died from flu. As it does for the numbers of flu cases, doctor’s visits and hospitalizations, CDC also estimates deaths in the United States using mathematical modeling. CDC estimates that from 2010-2011 to 2017-2018, influenza-associated deaths in the United States ranged from a low of 12,000 (during 2011-2012) to a high of 79,000 (during 2017-2018). The model used to estimate flu-associated deaths uses a ratio of deaths-to-hospitalizations in order to estimate the total flu-related deaths during a season. For more information: How CDC Estimates Burden. As data allow, CDC will begin reporting cumulative, in-season estimates of the influenza mortality burden. More information regarding these Preliminary In-Season Burden Estimates is available. For more information: Overview of Influenza Surveillance in the United States, “Mortality Surveillance.” Influenza-associated deaths in children (people younger than 18) became nationally reportable in 2004. Since that time the number of pediatric flu deaths reported to CDC each year has ranged from 37 (2011-2012 season) to 185 deaths (2017-2018 season). It’s important to note that the actual number of flu deaths in children is thought to be higher than what is reported by states to CDC because not all flu deaths in children are detected/reported. CDC also estimates the numbers of flu-related deaths using statistical models. Estimates of deaths in children since 2010 have ranged from 37 (2011-2012) to about 1,200 (2012-2013). CDC believes these estimated numbers of pediatric deaths are likely a better estimate of the number of pediatric flu deaths. For more information on these estimates see CDC’s Disease Burden of Influenza page. There are several factors that make it difficult to determine accurate numbers of deaths caused by flu regardless of reporting. Some of the challenges in counting flu associated deaths include the following:  CDC recommends a yearly flu vaccine for everyone 6 months of age and older as the first and most important step in protecting against this serious disease. In addition to getting a seasonal flu vaccine, you can take everyday preventive actions like staying away from sick people and washing your hands to reduce the spread of germs. If you are sick with flu, stay home from work or school to prevent spreading flu to others. In addition, there are prescription medications called antiviral drugs that can be used to treat influenza illness. Encourage your loved ones to get vaccinated. Vaccination is especially important for people at high risk for developing flu complications, and their close contacts. Also, if you have a loved one who is at high risk of flu complications and they develop flu symptoms, encourage them to get a medical evaluation for possible treatment with flu antiviral drugs. These drugs work best if given within 48 hours of when symptoms start. CDC recommends that people who are at high risk for serious flu complications and who get flu symptoms during flu season be treated with flu antiviral drugs as quickly as possible without waiting for confirmatory testing. People who are not at high risk for serious flu complications may also be treated with flu antiviral drugs, especially if treatment can begin within 48 hours. Yes. Some children 6 months through 8 years of age will require two doses of flu vaccine for adequate protection from flu. Children in this age group who are getting vaccinated for the first time will need two doses of flu vaccine, spaced at least 4 weeks apart. Children who have only received one dose in their lifetime also need two doses. Your child’s doctor or other health care professional can tell you if your child needs two doses of flu vaccine. Children younger than 6 months old are at high risk of serious flu complications, but are too young to get a flu vaccine. Because of this, safeguarding them from flu is especially important. If you live with or care for an infant younger than 6 months old, you should get a flu vaccine to help protect them from flu. Advice for Caregivers of Young Children is available for more information. Everyone else who is around the baby also should be vaccinated. Also, studies have shown that flu vaccination of the mother during pregnancy can protect the baby after birth from flu infection for several months. In addition to getting vaccinated, you and your loved ones can take everyday preventive actions like staying away from sick people and washing your hands to reduce the spread of germs. If you are sick with flu, stay home from work or school to prevent spreading flu to others. Flu vaccine is produced by private manufacturers, so supply depends on manufacturers. For the 2018-2019 season, manufacturers projected they would provide between 163 million and 168 million doses of injectable vaccine for the U.S. market. (Projections may change as the season progresses.) Flu vaccine supply updates will be provided as they become available at Seasonal Influenza Vaccine & Total Doses Distributed. For the 2018-2019 flu season, ACIP recommends annual influenza vaccination for everyone 6 months and older with any licensed, age-appropriate flu vaccine (IIV, RIV4, or LAIV4) with no preference expressed for any one vaccine over another. There are many vaccine options to choose from; the most important thing is for all people 6 months and older to get a flu vaccine every year. If you have questions about which vaccine is best for you, talk to your doctor or other health care professional. While observational data from 2010-11 through 2015-16 flu seasons indicate that LAIV was not effective among 2 through 17-year-olds against H1N1pdm09 influenza viruses in the U.S., LAIV was effective against influenza B viruses, and was similarly effective to inactivated influenza vaccines against H3N2 viruses. Some data suggest that the new H1N1 vaccine virus included in the new LAIV vaccines will have improved effectiveness against circulating H1N1 viruses; however, no published effectiveness estimates are available yet. Getting vaccinated before flu activity begins helps protect you once flu season starts in your community. It takes about two weeks after vaccination for the body’s immune response to fully respond and for you to be protected, so make plans to get vaccinated. CDC recommends that people get a flu vaccine by the end of October. However, getting vaccinated later can still be beneficial. CDC recommends ongoing flu vaccination as long as influenza viruses are circulating, even into January or later. Children 6 months to 8 years old who need two doses of vaccine should get the first dose as soon after vaccine is available to allow time to get the second dose before the start of flu season. The two doses should be given at least 4 weeks apart. Flu vaccines are offered by many doctor’s offices, clinics, health departments, pharmacies and college health centers, as well as by many employers, and even by some schools. Even if you don’t have a regular doctor or nurse, you can get a flu vaccine somewhere else, like a health department, pharmacy, urgent care clinic, and often your school, college health center, or work. The HealthMap Vaccine Finder helps you to locate where you can get a flu vaccine. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved two influenza vaccines (Afluria and Afluria Quadrivalent) for administration by a jet injector device (the PharmaJet Stratis 0.5ml Needle-free Jet Injector) for people 18 through 64 years of age. These are the only two influenza vaccines approved for administration by jet injector. People aged 18 through 64 years may receive these vaccines either by jet injector or needle. A jet injector is a medical device used for vaccination that uses a high-pressure, narrow stream of fluid to penetrate the skin instead of a hypodermic needle. More information about Flu Vaccination by Jet Injector is available. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed a seasonal influenza (flu) vaccine containing adjuvant for adults 65 years of age and older. An adjuvant is an ingredient added to a vaccine to create a stronger immune response to vaccination. FLUAD was licensed in November 2015 and will be available during the 2018-2019 flu season. It contains the MF59 adjuvant, an oil-in-water emulsion of squalene oil. FLUAD™ is the first adjuvanted seasonal flu vaccine marketed in the United States. Multiple studies conducted over different seasons and across flu vaccine types and influenza virus subtypes have shown that the body’s immunity to influenza viruses (acquired either through natural infection or vaccination) declines over time. The decline in antibodies is influenced by several factors, including the antigen used in the vaccine, the age of the person being vaccinated, and the person’s general health (for example, certain chronic health conditions may have an impact on immunity). Older people and others with weakened immune systems may not generate the same amount of antibodies after vaccination; further, their antibody levels may drop more quickly when compared to young, healthy people. Getting vaccinated each year provides the best protection against flu throughout flu season. It’s important to get a flu vaccine every season, even if you got vaccinated the season before and the viruses in the flu vaccine have not changed for the current season. Yes. It’s possible to get sick with flu even if you have been vaccinated (although you won’t know for sure unless you get a flu test). This is possible for the following reasons: Influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) can vary from season to season and among different age and risk groups and even by vaccine type. How well the vaccine works can depend in part on the match between the vaccine viruses used to produce vaccine and circulating viruses that season. It’s not possible to predict in advance what flu viruses will predominate. CDC monitors circulating viruses throughout the year and provides new and updated information about their similarity to flu vaccine viruses as it becomes available. Information is published weekly in FluView and summarized at intervals in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Vaccine effectiveness estimates are also provided when they become available. While vaccine effectiveness can vary, recent studies show vaccine reduces the risk of flu illness by about 40% to 60% among the overall population during seasons when most circulating flu viruses are like the vaccine viruses. Similar reductions against hospitalization have been observed too. More information about previous vaccine effectiveness, is available. It’s not possible to predict with certainty if a flu vaccine will be a good match for circulating flu viruses. A flu vaccine is made to protect against the flu viruses that research and surveillance indicate will likely be most common during the season. However, experts must pick which flu viruses to include in a flu vaccine many months in advance in order for flu vaccines to be produced and delivered on time. Also flu viruses change constantly (called “drift”). They can change from one season to the next or they can even change within the course of one flu season. Another factor that can impact vaccine effectiveness, especially against influenza A(H3N2) viruses, are changes that can occur in vaccine viruses as they are grown in eggs, which is the production method for most current flu vaccines. Because of these factors, there is always the possibility of a less than optimal match between circulating flu viruses and the viruses in a flu vaccine. Over the course of flu season, CDC studies samples of circulating flu viruses to evaluate how close a match there is between viruses used to make the flu vaccine and circulating flu viruses. One of the ways that helps CDC evaluate the match between flu vaccine viruses and circulating flu viruses is with a lab process called ‘genetic and antigenic characterization’. Results of genetic and antigenic characterization testing are published weekly in CDC’s FluView. Yes, antibodies made in response to vaccination with one flu virus can sometimes provide protection against different but related flu viruses. A less than ideal match may result in reduced vaccine effectiveness against the flu virus that is different from what is in the flu vaccine, but it might still provide some protection against flu illness. In addition, it’s important to remember that a flu vaccine contains three or four flu viruses (depending on the type of vaccine you receive) so that even when there is a less than ideal match or lower effectiveness against one virus, a flu vaccine may protect against the other flu viruses. For these reasons, even during seasons when there is a less than ideal match, CDC continues to recommend flu vaccination for everyone 6 months and older. Vaccination is particularly important for people at high risk for serious flu complications, and their close contacts. Influenza viruses usually infect the respiratory tract (i.e., the airways of the nose, throat and lungs). As the infection progresses, the body’s immune system responds to fight the virus. This results in inflammation that can trigger respiratory symptoms such as cough and sore throat. The immune system response can also trigger fever and cause muscle or body aches. When infected persons cough, sneeze, or talk, they can spread influenza viruses in respiratory droplets to people who are nearby. People might also get flu by touching a contaminated surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth or nose. Most people who become sick will recover in a few days to less than two weeks, but some people may become more severely ill. Following flu infection, moderate complications such as secondary ear and sinus infections can occur. Pneumonia is a serious flu complication that can result from either influenza virus infection alone or from co-infection of flu virus and bacteria. Other possible serious complications triggered by flu can include inflammation of the heart (myocarditis), brain (encephalitis) or muscle (myositis, rhabdomyolysis) tissues, and multi-organ failure (for example, respiratory and kidney failure). Severe complications can happen to anyone, but may be more likely to happen to people who have certain chronic medical conditions, or in elderly persons. Most people with flu have mild illness and do not need medical care or antiviral drugs. If you get sick with flu symptoms, in most cases, you should stay home and avoid contact with other people except to get medical care. If, however, you have symptoms of flu and are at high risk of flu complications, or are very sick or concerned about your illness, contact your health care provider. There are drugs your doctor may prescribe for treating flu called antivirals. These drugs can make you better faster and may also prevent serious complications. Antiviral drugs are prescription drugs that can be used to treat flu illness. People at high risk of serious flu complications recommended for prompt antiviral treatment include children younger than 2 years of age (although all children younger than 5 years are considered at higher risk for complications from influenza, the highest risk is for those younger than 2 years of age), adults 65 years of age and older, pregnant women, people with certain long-term medical conditions, and residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities). Antiviral treatment as early as possible is also recommended for people who are very sick with flu (such as those with complicated, progressive illness or people hospitalized because of flu). Other people can be treated with antivirals at their health care professional’s discretion. Treating high risk people or people who are very sick with flu with antiviral drugs is very important. Studies show that prompt treatment with antiviral drugs can prevent serious flu complications. Prompt treatment can mean the difference between having a milder illness versus very serious illness that could result in a hospital stay. Treatment with antivirals works best when begun within 48 hours of getting sick, but can still be beneficial when given later in the course of illness. Antiviral drugs are effective across all age and risk groups. Studies show that antiviral drugs are under-prescribed for people who are at high risk of complications who get flu. Four FDA-approved antiviral medications are recommended for use during the 2018-2019 flu season: oseltamivir (available in generic versions and under the trade name Tamiflu®), zanamivir (Relenza®), peramivir (Rapivab®), and baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza®). More information about antiviral drugs can be found at Treatment – Antiviral Drugs. This guidance is consistent with the 2018-2019 flu season recommendations published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) on December 19 in Clinical Infectious Diseases. “The Flu: What To Do If You Get Sick” Baloxavir marboxil (trade name Xofluza®) is an influenza single-dose antiviral drug approved October 24, 2018 by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Baloxavir is approved for the treatment of acute uncomplicated flu in people 12 years and older who have had flu symptoms for less than 48 hours. In clinical randomized trials, baloxavir was similar to oseltamivir, a currently recommended flu antiviral drug, in alleviating flu symptoms. More information regarding baloxaviris available: Influenza Antiviral Drug Baloxavir Marboxil. The Epidemiology and Prevention Branch in the Influenza Division at CDC collects, compiles and analyzes information on flu activity year round in the United States and produces FluView, a weekly influenza surveillance report, and FluView Interactive, which allows for more in-depth exploration of influenza surveillance data. The U.S. influenza surveillance system is a collaborative effort between CDC and its many partners in state, local, and territorial health departments, public health and clinical laboratories, vital statistics offices, healthcare providers, clinics, and emergency departments. Information in five categories is collected from eight different data sources that allow CDC to: For more information, visit “Overview of Influenza Surveillance in the United States”. CDC collaborates with partners each season to assess how well the seasonal flu vaccines are working. During the 2018-2019 season, CDC is planning multiple studies on the effectiveness of flu shots. These studies measure vaccine effectiveness in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza among persons 6 months of age and older. A summary of CDC’s latest vaccine effectiveness estimates is available at Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness, 2005-2018. Antiviral resistance means that a virus has changed in such a way that antiviral drugs are less effective or not effective at all in treating or preventing illnesses with that virus. CDC will continue to collect and monitor flu viruses for changes through an established network of domestic and global surveillance systems. CDC also is working with the state public health departments and the World Health Organization to collect additional information on antiviral resistance in the United States and worldwide. The information collected will assist in making informed recommendations regarding use of antiviral drugs to treat influenza.",Baloxavir is approved for the treatment of acute uncomplicated flu in people 12 years and older who have had flu symptoms for less than 48 hours.,"Options this season include: There is a table showing all flu vaccines that are FDA-approved for use in the United States during the 2018-2019 season.
It takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies that protect against flu to develop in the body, so make plans to get vaccinated early in fall, before flu season begins.
CDC recommends that people get a flu vaccine by the end of October.
Vaccine effectiveness depends in part on the match between the vaccine virus and circulating flu viruses.
Most of the time flu activity peaks between December and February, and it can last as late as May. CDC monitors certain key flu indicators (for example, outpatient visits of influenza-like illness (ILI), the results of laboratory testing and reports of flu hospitalizations and deaths).
CDC conducts surveillance for people who see their health care provider for flu-like illness through the Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet); a network of thousands of health care providers who report the proportion of patients seeking care for flu-like illness weekly to CDC.
CDC does not know exactly how many people get sick with seasonal flu each year.
During the 2018-2019 flu season, CDC began reporting cumulative, in-season estimates of the disease burden of influenza, including estimates of the total number of flu illnesses in the United States.
During the 2018-2019 flu season, CDC began reporting cumulative, in-season estimates of disease burden of influenza, including estimates of the total number of people hospitalized in the United States from flu.
Some of the challenges in counting flu associated deaths include the following:  CDC recommends a yearly flu vaccine for everyone 6 months of age and older as the first and most important step in protecting against this serious disease.
In addition to getting a seasonal flu vaccine, you can take everyday preventive actions like staying away from sick people and washing your hands to reduce the spread of germs.
Vaccination is especially important for people at high risk for developing flu complications, and their close contacts.
CDC recommends that people who are at high risk for serious flu complications and who get flu symptoms during flu season be treated with flu antiviral drugs as quickly as possible without waiting for confirmatory testing.
(Projections may change as the season progresses.) Flu vaccine supply updates will be provided as they become available at Seasonal Influenza Vaccine & Total Doses Distributed.
For the 2018-2019 flu season, ACIP recommends annual influenza vaccination for everyone 6 months and older with any licensed, age-appropriate flu vaccine (IIV, RIV4, or LAIV4) with no preference expressed for any one vaccine over another.
While observational data from 2010-11 through 2015-16 flu seasons indicate that LAIV was not effective among 2 through 17-year-olds against H1N1pdm09 influenza viruses in the U.S., LAIV was effective against influenza B viruses, and was similarly effective to inactivated influenza vaccines against H3N2 viruses.
Getting vaccinated before flu activity begins helps protect you once flu season starts in your community.
CDC recommends that people get a flu vaccine by the end of October.
CDC recommends ongoing flu vaccination as long as influenza viruses are circulating, even into January or later.
Children 6 months to 8 years old who need two doses of vaccine should get the first dose as soon after vaccine is available to allow time to get the second dose before the start of flu season.
More information about Flu Vaccination by Jet Injector is available.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed a seasonal influenza (flu) vaccine containing adjuvant for adults 65 years of age and older.
FLUAD™ is the first adjuvanted seasonal flu vaccine marketed in the United States.
Multiple studies conducted over different seasons and across flu vaccine types and influenza virus subtypes have shown that the body’s immunity to influenza viruses (acquired either through natural infection or vaccination) declines over time.
Getting vaccinated each year provides the best protection against flu throughout flu season.
It’s important to get a flu vaccine every season, even if you got vaccinated the season before and the viruses in the flu vaccine have not changed for the current season.
CDC monitors circulating viruses throughout the year and provides new and updated information about their similarity to flu vaccine viruses as it becomes available.
While vaccine effectiveness can vary, recent studies show vaccine reduces the risk of flu illness by about 40% to 60% among the overall population during seasons when most circulating flu viruses are like the vaccine viruses.
A flu vaccine is made to protect against the flu viruses that research and surveillance indicate will likely be most common during the season.
Another factor that can impact vaccine effectiveness, especially against influenza A(H3N2) viruses, are changes that can occur in vaccine viruses as they are grown in eggs, which is the production method for most current flu vaccines.

2018-2019,How does CDC estimate the burden of seasonal flu on the United States?,"The burden of influenza on the United States can vary widely from season to season and is determined by a number of factors including the characteristics of circulating viruses, the timing of the season, population immunity to circulating viruses, how well flu vaccines are working, and how many people have gotten vaccinated. While the impact of flu varies, it places a substantial burden on the health of people in the United States each year. CDC uses a model to estimate the numbers of influenza illnesses, medical visits, and hospitalizations in the United States (as well as the impact of influenza vaccination on these numbers). The same model is also extended to estimate flu-related deaths in the United States. This methodology has been used to retroactively calculate influenza burden, including deaths, going back to 2010. Starting with the 2018-2019 flu season, CDC will report cumulative, in-season estimates of the burden of influenza. These Preliminary In-Season Burden Estimates will be updated weekly over the course of the flu season. In 2017, CDC adopted and outlined a new methodology for determining flu season severity. Based on data from past flu seasons, CDC researchers used key flu indicator data to develop intensity thresholds (ITs) to classify the severity of flu seasons. Based on the intensity thresholds, CDC researchers classified seasonal severity from 2003-2004 through the 2017-2018 flu seasons. Overall, four seasons were classified as low severity, seven as moderate, two as high, and none as very high. Influenza (flu) places a significant disease burden on the U.S. population each year, but the magnitude and timing varies from season to season, making the annual impact difficult to predict at the beginning of each season. Flu forecasting can change that by predicting in advance when the start, peak, and increases in flu activity will occur. Unlike CDC’s traditional influenza surveillance systems, which measure influenza activity after it has occurred, flu forecasting offers the possibility to look into the future and better plan ahead, potentially reducing the impact of flu.","Based on data from past flu seasons, CDC researchers used key flu indicator data to develop intensity thresholds (ITs) to classify the severity of flu seasons.","The burden of influenza on the United States can vary widely from season to season and is determined by a number of factors including the characteristics of circulating viruses, the timing of the season, population immunity to circulating viruses, how well flu vaccines are working, and how many people have gotten vaccinated.

2019-2020,What’s new this flu season?,"A few things are new this season: For more information on 2019-2020 influenza vaccine recommendations: Prevention and Control of Seasonal Influenza with Vaccines: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices — United States, 2019–20 Influenza Season What flu vaccines are recommended this season? For the 2019-2020 flu season, providers may choose to administer any licensed, age-appropriate flu vaccine (IIV, RIV4, or LAIV4). Options this season include: There is a table showing all flu vaccines that are FDA-approved for use in the United States during the 2019-2020 season. What viruses will the 2019-2020 flu vaccines protect against? There are many different flu viruses and they are constantly changing. The composition of U.S. flu vaccines is reviewed annually and updated as needed to match circulating flu viruses. Flu vaccines protect against the three or four viruses (depending on the vaccine) that research suggests will be most common. For 2019-2020, trivalent (three-component) vaccines are recommended to contain: Quadrivalent (four-component) vaccines, which protect against a second lineage of B viruses, are recommended to contain: FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) chooses the flu vaccine viruses for the United States. For 2019-2020 vaccines, they selected the H1N1 and B components on March 6, 2019. Selection of the H3N2 component was delayed until March 22, 2019. How well-matched are 2019-2020 vaccine viruses to circulating flu viruses? How well is flu vaccine protecting against illness? It’s understandable that people want to know how well flu vaccines are working or are expected to work this season. CDC does not have flu vaccine effectiveness estimates for this season yet because it is still early in the season and these estimates are based on epidemiologic studies comparing illness among vaccinated versus unvaccinated people. That data will be available later. In the meantime, laboratory data can provide some insight into how well vaccines might work. The most helpful data for this is the antigenic characterization data, which are updated weekly in FluView. Limited antigenic data on recently circulating viruses are available at this point in the season, and the data suggest similarity of the circulating influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and B/Yamagata viruses tested so far to the vaccine viruses. However, the influenza B/Victoria and A(H3N2) viruses that have been tested show some reduced similarity to the vaccine viruses. Again, at this point in the flu season, the antigenic data are limited and can only give early insights into how well vaccines might work. More information about how CDC antigenically characterizes flu viruses is available, and more complete antigenic data will be available in the coming weeks. During past seasons when vaccine viruses were antigenically “like” most circulating viruses, vaccine effectiveness in the range of 40% to 60% has been observed. This means that people who get vaccinated may still get sick, but they are about half as likely to get sick as someone who was not vaccinated. Another important thing to remember is that vaccination may make illness less severe in people who get vaccinated and still get sick. In general people who get vaccinated are better off than people who do not get vaccinated. It’s important to remember though, that things can change very quickly with flu and we could still see circulation of flu viruses with significant antigenic drift this season. More information regarding flu vaccine effectiveness is available below.",Options this season include: There is a table showing all flu vaccines that are FDA-approved for use in the United States during the 2019-2020 season.,"What viruses will the 2019-2020 flu vaccines protect against?

2019-2020,Implications of Cell-Based Vaccines,"For people who need only one dose for the season, vaccinating early – for example, in July or August –may lead to reduced protection against flu later in the season, particularly among older adults. While vaccination should optimally occur before the onset of flu activity in the community, providers should continue to offer and encourage vaccination as long as flu viruses are circulating and unexpired vaccine is available. To avoid missed opportunities for vaccination, vaccination can be offered during routine health care visits and hospitalizations. Can I get a flu vaccine if I am allergic to eggs? The recommendations for people with egg allergies are unchanged and as follows: Why is it significant that cell-grown vaccine viruses are used to produce one flu vaccine? Cell-grown vaccine viruses do not have changes that may be present in egg-grown reference viruses, so they should be more similar to circulating “wild-type” viruses. Vaccine effectiveness depends in part on the match between the vaccine virus and circulating flu viruses. Is flu vaccine made using a cell-grown vaccine virus and cell-based technology more effective than vaccine made using an egg-grown vaccine virus and egg-based technology? While the use of cell-grown vaccine viruses and cell-based technology may offer the potential for better protection over traditional, egg-based flu vaccines because they result in vaccine viruses that are more similar to flu viruses in circulation, there are no vaccine effectiveness data to support this. There is no preferential recommendation for one flu vaccine over another.",There is no preferential recommendation for one flu vaccine over another.,"The recommendations for people with egg allergies are unchanged and as follows: Why is it significant that cell-grown vaccine viruses are used to produce one flu vaccine?

2019-2020,Flu Activity,"What sort of flu season is expected this year? Influenza is unpredictable. While flu spreads every year, the timing, severity, and length of the season varies from one season to another. Will new flu viruses circulate this season? Flu viruses are constantly changing so it’s not unusual for new flu viruses to appear each year. More information about how flu viruses change is available. Will the United States have a flu epidemic? The United States experiences annual epidemics of seasonal flu. This time of year is called “flu season.” In the United States, flu viruses are most common during the fall and winter months. Flu activity often begins to increase in October and November. Most of the time flu activity peaks between December and February, and it can last as late as May. CDC monitors certain key flu indicators (for example, outpatient visits of influenza-like illness (ILI), the results of laboratory testing and reports of flu hospitalizations and deaths). When these indicators rise and remain elevated for a number of consecutive weeks, “flu season” is said to have begun. Usually ILI increases first, followed by an increase in flu-associated hospitalizations, which is then followed by increases in flu-associated deaths. For the most current flu surveillance information: Weekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report. When will flu activity begin and when will it peak? The timing of flu is unpredictable and can vary in different parts of the country and from season to season. Seasonal flu viruses can be detected year-round; however, seasonal flu activity often begins as early as October and November and can continue to occur as late as May. Flu activity most commonly peaks in the United States between December and February. What should I do to protect myself from flu this season? CDC recommends a yearly flu vaccine for everyone 6 months of age and older as the first and most important step in protecting against this potentially serious disease. In addition to getting a seasonal flu vaccine, you can take everyday preventive actions like staying away from sick people and washing your hands to reduce the spread of germs. If you are sick with flu, stay home from work or school to prevent spreading flu to others. In addition, there are prescription medications called antiviral drugs that can be used to treat flu illness. What should I do to protect my loved ones from flu this season? Encourage your loved ones to get vaccinated. Vaccination is especially important for people at high risk of developing flu complications, and their close contacts. Also, if you have a loved one who is at high risk of developing flu complications and they get flu symptoms, encourage them to seek medical attention for possible treatment with a flu antiviral drug. These drugs work best if given within 48 hours of when symptoms start. CDC recommends that people who are at high risk of developing serious flu complications and who get flu symptoms during flu season be treated with flu antiviral drugs as quickly as possible without waiting for confirmatory testing. People who are not at high risk of developing serious flu complications may also be treated with flu antiviral drugs, especially if treatment can begin within 48 hours. Do some children require two doses of flu vaccine? As in previous seasons, some children 6 months through 8 years of age will need 2 doses of flu vaccine this season. Children in this age group who have not previously received two or more total doses of any trivalent or quadrivalent flu vaccine (including the nasal spray vaccine) before July 1, 2019, or whose vaccination history is not known, need two doses of 2019-2020 flu vaccine administered at least 4 weeks apart. For 8-year-olds who need two doses, the second dose is recommended even if the child turns 9 years of age between receipt of dose 1 and dose 2. Children in this age group who have received two or more total doses of trivalent or quadrivalent flu vaccine before July 1, 2019 need only one dose for this season. What can I do to protect children who are too young to get vaccinated? Children younger than 6 months old are at high risk of serious flu complications, but are too young to get a flu vaccine. Because of this, safeguarding them from flu is especially important. If you live with or care for an infant younger than 6 months old, you should get a flu vaccine to help protect them from flu. Advice for Caregivers of Young Children is available for more information. Everyone else who is around the baby also should be vaccinated. Also, studies have shown that flu vaccination of the mother during pregnancy can protect the baby after birth from flu infection for several months.

2019-2020,Vaccine and Vaccination,"How much flu vaccine will be available this season? Flu vaccine is produced by private manufacturers, so supply depends on manufacturers. For the 2019-2020 season, manufacturers have projected they will provide as many as 162 million to 169 million doses of flu vaccine, which is similar to projected supply for last season. Flu vaccine supply updates will be provided as they become available at Seasonal Influenza Vaccine & Total Doses Distributed. Are any of the available flu vaccines recommended over the others? For the 2019-2020 flu season, ACIP recommends annual flu vaccination for everyone 6 months and older with any licensed, age-appropriate flu vaccine (IIV, RIV4, or LAIV4) with no preference expressed for any one vaccine over another. There are many vaccine options to choose from; the most important thing is for all people 6 months and older to get a flu vaccine every year. If you have questions about which vaccine is best for you, talk to your doctor or other health care professional. Why is the nasal spray being recommended as an option this year when it has been shown to not be effective in past flu seasons? Flu vaccine effectiveness (VE) can vary from year to year, among different age and risk groups, by vaccine type, and even by virus type and subtype. While data from 2010-2011 through 2016-2017 indicated that nasal spray vaccine lacked effectiveness among 2 through 17-year-olds against H1N1 viruses in the U.S., nasal spray vaccine was effective against influenza B viruses, and was similarly effective against H3N2 viruses as inactivated influenza vaccines. Since the 2018-2019 season, the manufacturer of nasal spray vaccine has used a new H1N1 vaccine virus in production. Some data suggest this will result in improved effectiveness of against H1N1. However, no published effectiveness estimates for this vaccine component against H1N1 viruses are available. ACIP and CDC voted to resume the recommendation for the use of nasal spray vaccines based on evidence suggesting that the new H1N1 component will result in improved effectiveness of the vaccine against these viruses.

2019-2020,Flu Vaccine Effectiveness,"How effective will flu vaccines be this season? It’s not possible to say in advance exactly how well the flu vaccine will work this season. How well it works can vary by season, virus type/subtype, the kind of vaccine, and age and other host factors of the people being vaccinated. At least two factors play an important role in determining the likelihood that flu vaccines will protect a person from flu illness: 1) characteristics of the person being vaccinated (such as their age and health), and 2) the similarity or “match” between the flu viruses in the vaccine and those spreading in the community. During years when the viruses in the flu vaccine and circulating flu viruses are well matched, it’s possible to measure substantial benefits from flu vaccination in terms of preventing flu illness. However, even during years when the vaccine match is good, the benefits of flu vaccination will vary across the population, depending on host factors like the health and age of the person being vaccinated and even potentially which flu vaccine was used. Recent studies by CDC researchers and other researchers suggest that flu vaccination usually reduces the risk of influenza illness by 40% to 60% among the overall population when the vaccine viruses are like the ones spreading in the community. For more information about vaccine effectiveness, click here. Will this season’s flu vaccine be a good match for circulating viruses? It’s not possible to predict with certainty if a flu vaccine will be a good match for circulating flu viruses. A flu vaccine is made to protect against the flu viruses that research and surveillance indicate will likely be most common during the season. However, scientists must pick which flu viruses to include in a flu vaccine many months in advance in order for flu vaccines to be produced and delivered on time. Also flu viruses change constantly (called “drift”). They can change from one season to the next or they can even change within the course of one flu season. Another factor that can impact vaccine effectiveness, especially against influenza A(H3N2) viruses, are changes that can occur in vaccine viruses as they are grown in eggs, which is the production method for most current flu vaccines. Because of these factors, there is always the possibility of a less than optimal match between circulating flu viruses and the viruses in a flu vaccine. Over the course of flu season, CDC studies samples of circulating flu viruses to evaluate how close a match there is between viruses used to make the flu vaccine and circulating flu viruses. One of the ways that helps CDC evaluate the match between flu vaccine viruses and circulating flu viruses is with a lab process called ‘genetic and antigenic characterization’. Results of genetic and antigenic characterization testing are published weekly in CDC’s FluView. Can a flu vaccine provide protection even if the flu vaccine is not a “good” match? Yes, antibodies made in response to vaccination with one flu virus sometimes can provide protection against different but related flu viruses. A less than ideal match may result in reduced vaccine effectiveness against the flu virus that is different from what is in the flu vaccine, but it might still provide some protection against flu illness. In addition, it’s important to remember that a flu vaccine contains three or four flu viruses (depending on the type of vaccine you receive) so that even when there is a less than ideal match or lower effectiveness against one virus, a flu vaccine may protect against the other flu viruses. For these reasons, even during seasons when there is a less than ideal match, CDC continues to recommend flu vaccination for everyone 6 months and older. Vaccination is particularly important for people at high risk for serious flu complications, and their close contacts.","Another factor that can impact vaccine effectiveness, especially against influenza A(H3N2) viruses, are changes that can occur in vaccine viruses as they are grown in eggs, which is the production method for most current flu vaccines.","Will this season’s flu vaccine be a good match for circulating viruses?

2019-2020,If You Get Sick,"What happens in the body when someone has flu? Flu viruses usually infect the respiratory tract (i.e., the airways of the nose, throat and lungs). As the infection progresses, the body’s immune system responds to fight the virus. This results in inflammation that can trigger respiratory symptoms such as cough and sore throat. The immune system response also can trigger fever and cause muscle or body aches. When infected people cough, sneeze, or talk, they can spread flu viruses in respiratory droplets to people who are nearby. People might also get flu by touching a contaminated surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth or nose. Most people who become sick will recover in a few days to less than two weeks, but some people may become more severely ill. Following flu infection, moderate complications such as secondary ear and sinus infections can occur. Pneumonia is a serious flu complication that can result from either flu virus infection alone or from co-infection of flu virus and bacteria. Other possible serious complications triggered by flu can include inflammation of the heart (myocarditis), brain (encephalitis) or muscle (myositis, rhabdomyolysis) tissues, and multi-organ failure (for example, respiratory and kidney failure). Severe complications can happen to anyone, but may be more likely to happen to people who have certain chronic medical conditions, or in elderly persons. What should I do if I get sick with flu? Most people with flu have mild illness and do not need medical care or antiviral drugs. If you get sick with flu symptoms, in most cases, you should stay home and avoid contact with other people except to get medical care. If, however, you have symptoms of flu and are at high risk of flu complications, or are very sick or concerned about your illness, contact your health care provider. There are drugs your doctor may prescribe for treating flu called antivirals. These drugs can make you better faster and may also prevent serious complications. Antiviral drugs are prescription drugs that can be used to treat flu illness. People at high risk of serious flu complications recommended for prompt antiviral treatment include children younger than 2 years of age (although all children younger than 5 years are considered at higher risk for complications from flu, the highest risk is for those younger than 2 years of age), adults 65 years of age and older, pregnant women, people with certain long-term medical conditions, and residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities). Antiviral treatment as early as possible is also recommended for people who are very sick with flu (such as those with complicated, progressive illness or people hospitalized because of flu). Other people can be treated with antivirals at their health care professional’s discretion. Treating high risk people or people who are very sick with flu with antiviral drugs is very important. Studies show that prompt treatment with antiviral drugs can prevent serious flu complications. Prompt treatment can mean the difference between having a milder illness versus very serious illness that could result in a hospital stay. Treatment with antivirals works best when begun within 48 hours of getting sick. However, treatment can still be beneficial when given later in the course of illness. Antiviral drugs are effective across all age and risk groups. Studies show that antiviral drugs are under-prescribed for people who are at high risk of complications who get flu. Four FDA-approved antiviral medications are recommended for use during the 2019-2020 flu season: oseltamivir (available in generic versions and under the trade name Tamiflu®), zanamivir (Relenza®), peramivir (Rapivab®), and baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza®). More information about antiviral drugs can be found at Treatment – Antiviral Drugs. This guidance is consistent with the 2019-2020 flu season recommendations published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) on December 19, 2018, in Clinical Infectious Diseases. “The Flu: What To Do If You Get Sick” What is baloxavir marboxil? Baloxavir marboxil (trade name Xofluza®) is a flu single-dose antiviral drug approved October 24, 2018 by the FDA. Baloxavir is approved for the treatment of acute uncomplicated flu in people 12 years and older who have had flu symptoms for less than 48 hours. In clinical randomized trials, baloxavir was similar to oseltamivir, a currently recommended flu antiviral drug, in alleviating flu symptoms. More information regarding baloxavir is available: Influenza Antiviral Drug Baloxavir Marboxil.",Most people with flu have mild illness and do not need medical care or antiviral drugs.,"Most people with flu have mild illness and do not need medical care or antiviral drugs.

2019-2020,Surveillance,"How does CDC track flu activity? The Epidemiology and Prevention Branch in the Influenza Division at CDC collects, compiles and analyzes information on flu activity year round in the United States and produces FluView, a weekly flu surveillance report, and FluView Interactive, which allows for more in-depth exploration of flu surveillance data. The U.S. flu surveillance system is a collaborative effort between CDC and its many partners in state, local, and territorial health departments, public health and clinical laboratories, vital statistics offices, healthcare providers, clinics, and emergency departments. Information in five categories is collected from eight different data sources that allow CDC to: For more information, visit “Overview of Influenza Surveillance in the United States”. What will CDC do to monitor flu vaccine effectiveness for the 2019-2020 season? CDC collaborates with partners each season to assess how well the seasonal flu vaccines are working. During the 2019-2020 season, CDC is planning multiple studies on the effectiveness of flu vaccines. Researchers conduct these studies each year to measure how well flu vaccines work in order to continually assess and confirm their value as a public health measure. Part of the need for this continued assessment is that flu viruses that circulate each year tend to change and evolve, and so the components of the flu vaccine are changed relatively frequently to protect against these new circulating viruses. A summary of CDC’s latest vaccine effectiveness estimates is available at Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness, 2005-2018. What is CDC doing to monitor antiviral resistance in the United States during the 2019-2020 season? Antiviral resistance means that a virus has changed in such a way that antiviral drugs are less effective or not effective at all in treating or preventing illnesses with that virus. CDC will continue to collect and monitor flu viruses for changes through an established network of domestic and global surveillance systems. CDC also is working with the state public health departments and the World Health Organization to collect additional information on antiviral resistance in the United States and worldwide. The information collected will assist in making informed recommendations regarding use of antiviral drugs to treat flu.",The information collected will assist in making informed recommendations regarding use of antiviral drugs to treat flu.,"The Epidemiology and Prevention Branch in the Influenza Division at CDC collects, compiles and analyzes information on flu activity year round in the United States and produces FluView, a weekly flu surveillance report, and FluView Interactive, which allows for more in-depth exploration of flu surveillance data.

2020-2021,Summary,"Flu activity was unusually low throughout the 2020-2021 flu season both in the United States and globally, despite high levels of testing. During September 28, 2020–May 22, 2021 in the United States, 1,675 (0.2%) of 818,939 respiratory specimens tested by U.S. clinical laboratories were positive for an influenza virus. The low level of flu activity during this past season contributed to dramatically fewer flu illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths compared with previous flu seasons. For comparison, during the last three seasons before the pandemic, the proportion of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza peaked between 26.2% and 30.3%. In terms of hospitalizations, the cumulative rate of laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations in the 2020-2021 season was the lowest recorded since this type of data collection began in 2005. For pediatric deaths, CDC received one report of a pediatric flu death in a child during the 2020–2021 flu season. Since flu deaths in children became nationally notifiable in 2004, reported flu deaths in children had previously ranged from a low of 37 (during 2011-2012) to a high of 199 (during 2019-2020). COVID-19 mitigation measures such as wearing face masks, staying home, hand washing, school closures, reduced travel, increased ventilation of indoor spaces, and physical distancing, likely contributed to the decline in 2020-2021 flu incidence, hospitalizations and deaths. Influenza vaccination may also contributed to reduced flu illness during the 2020–2021 season. Flu vaccine effectiveness estimates for 2020-2021 are not available, but a record number of influenza vaccine doses (193.8 million doses) were distributed in the U.S. during 2020-2021. CDC works each year to increase the number of people who receive a flu vaccine and eliminate barriers to vaccination. Influenza vaccine production and distribution in the US are primarily private sector endeavors, but during the 2020-2021 flu season, as part of efforts to maximize flu vaccination by increasing availability of vaccine, CDC purchased an additional 2 million doses of pediatric and 9.3 million doses of adult influenza vaccine to create a stockpile of vaccine in case of supply problems. While final estimates are pending, early estimates based on survey data suggest flu vaccination uptake for 2020-2021 was similar to the prior season, with small increases among some groups of people and small decreases among other groups of people. Preliminary estimates indicate that 50% to 55% of adults got a flu vaccine (compared with the 2019–2020 estimate of 48% by end of May 2020). Influenza vaccination coverage in children dropped 4.1 percentage points from 62.3% during 2019-2020 to 58.2% during 2020–2021 and estimates for pregnant people and health care personnel indicated slight decreases in influenza vaccine coverage. Racial and ethnic disparities in flu vaccine uptake persisted for children and adults. Because racial and ethnic minority groups might be at higher risk for developing serious illness, resulting from flu that may lead to hospitalization, flu vaccination is especially important for these communities. Flu viruses are constantly changing so it’s not unusual for new flu viruses to appear each year. During the 2020-2021 flu season, there was very low circulation of seasonal flu viruses. During September 27, 2020–May 22, 2021 in the United States, 1,899 (0.2%) of 1,081,671 clinical samples tested were positive for an influenza virus (713 [37.5%] influenza A and 1,186 [62.5%] influenza B). During that same period, public health laboratories reported 61.4% of influenza positive samples were influenza A and 38.6% of positive samples were influenza B. The majority (52.5%) of influenza A viruses were H3N2, and the majority (60%) of influenza B viruses were of Victoria lineage. In terms of novel influenza viruses, CDC reported five human infections with an influenza virus that usually spreads in pigs and not people (called a variant influenza virus) in the United States. All five of these infections occurred in people who reported that they had direct exposure to pigs or lived on a property where pigs were present. No person-to-person spread of variant influenza was identified associated with any of these patients. These types of infections occur in people rarely, and usually in the context of exposure to pigs, but are concerning because of their pandemic potential. Since 2005, a total of 489 variant influenza virus infections have been identified in the United States and reported to CDC. More information about how flu viruses change is available. For 2020-2021, trivalent (three-component) egg-based vaccines contained: Quadrivalent (four-component) egg-based vaccines, which protect against a second lineage of B viruses, contained: For 2020-2021, cell- or recombinant-based vaccines contained: Yes, 2020-2021 flu vaccines were updated to better match the flu viruses that were expected to circulate in the United States. There were two new vaccines licensed for use during the 2020-2021 flu season. More information about new vaccines available in 2020-2021. For the 2020-2021 flu season, providers could choose to administer any licensed, age-appropriate flu vaccine (IIV, RIV4, or LAIV4) with no preference for any one vaccine over another. Vaccine options included: Flu vaccine is produced by private manufacturers, so supply depends on manufacturers. For the 2020-2021 season, manufacturers projected they would provide as many as 194-198 million doses of flu vaccine, which is more than the 175 million dose record set during the 2019-2020 flu season. 193.8 million doses of flu vaccine had been distributed in the United States as of February 26, 2021—the highest number of doses in a single flu season. CDC provided weekly updates on total flu vaccine doses distributed throughout the 2020-2021 flu season. Influenza vaccine manufacturers did not report any significant delays in national flu vaccine supply or distribution during 2020-2021. Yes. Vaccine manufactures reported distributing 193.8 million doses of flu vaccine in the United States as of February 26, 2021. This was more flu vaccine than had ever previously been distributed in the United States. Some of this distributed vaccine was likely was not administered. In the United States in general, every year, there are a number of doses of flu vaccine that go unused. CDC provided weekly updates on total flu vaccine doses distributed throughout the 2020-2021 flu season. There was no change in CDC’s recommendation on timing of vaccination last flu season. Getting vaccinated in July or August is too early, especially for older people, because of the likelihood of reduced protection against flu later in the flu season. September and October are good times to get vaccinated. However, as long as flu viruses are circulating, vaccination should continue, even in January or later. More information for vaccination timing for the 2020-2021 flu season Prior to the 2020-2021 flu season, CDC worked with health care providers and state and local health departments to develop contingency plans on how to vaccinate people against flu without increasing their risk of exposure to respiratory disease, like the virus that causes COVID-19. This included releasing  Interim Guidance for Immunization Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic. Preliminary coverage data from September 2020 suggest there were some changes in where people got vaccinated early in 2020-2021. For example, the proportion of people reporting getting a flu vaccination at a store (53.8%) was significantly higher than the equivalent proportion for the 2019–20 season (34.9%), and the proportion reporting vaccination at a doctor’s office was significantly lower than 2019–20 (29.7% vs 37.3%). No. As recommended by ACIP  during the 2020-2021 flu season, out of an abundance of caution, COVID-19 vaccines were administered alone, with a minimum interval of 14 days before or after administration of any other vaccines, including influenza vaccines. This recommendation has since been updated. To address the importance of flu vaccination, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, CDC increased the availability of vaccine, including purchasing an additional 2 million doses of pediatric flu vaccine and 9.3 million doses of adult flu vaccine to create a stockpile of vaccine in case of supply problems. CDC also emphasized the importance of flu vaccination for the entire flu season and conducted targeted communication outreach to specific groups who are at higher risk for complications from flu. These same groups are often at higher risk for COVID-19, too, so protecting them from influenza was important to decrease their risk of co-infection. Communication strategies for providers and the public included: CDC developed a new Weekly National Influenza Vaccination Dashboard designed to share preliminary, in-season, weekly influenza vaccination coverage estimates and related data. The dashboard included information on the number of influenza vaccine doses distributed in the United States, weekly flu vaccination coverage rates for children 6 months – 17 years old, monthly flu vaccination coverage rates among pregnant persons, and information on how many flu vaccines were administered in pharmacies and doctor’s offices. The data was updated weekly or monthly, depending on the data source, throughout the 2020-2021 influenza season; other data sources were added as they become available. Visit the National Influenza Vaccination Dashboard for more information. CDC also provided seasonal flu vaccination coverage estimates at the end of flu season. Influenza vaccination coverage among children was assessed through the National Immunization Survey-Flu (NIS-Flu), which provided weekly influenza vaccination coverage estimates for children 6 months–17 years old. NIS-Flu is a national random-digit-dialed cellular telephone survey of households conducted during the flu season (October-June). Additional information about NIS-Flu methods and estimates from 2019-2020 season are available at FluVaxView. Monthly flu vaccination coverage estimates among pregnant women are based on electronic health record (EHR) data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), a collaboration between CDC’s Immunization Safety Office and nine integrated health care organizations. Of note, because these estimates are based on data from nine integrated health care systems, they may not be representative of all pregnant women in the U.S. CDC tracked the number of flu vaccines administered at pharmacies and doctor’s offices by using new sources of vaccination data, including IQVIA data for vaccinations administered in retail pharmacies (e.g., chain, mass merchandise, food stores, and independent pharmacies) and doctor’s offices. CDC launched the first weekly FluVaxView dashboard in December. The number of flu vaccine doses distributed, vaccination coverage estimates for children, and vaccinations administered in retail pharmacies and doctor’s offices were updated weekly. Coverage estimates for pregnant women were updated monthly. Visit the National Influenza Vaccination Dashboard for more information. For each flu season since 2009-2010, CDC has estimated annual influenza vaccination coverage for the United States by using data from several nationally representative surveys: the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), and the National Immunization Survey-Flu (NIS-Flu). Internet panel surveys of adults, health care personnel, and pregnant women are also used. Click here for vaccination coverage estimates from past flu seasons. CDC will continue to provide end of season estimates of influenza vaccination coverage from these data sources. For the 2020-21 flu season, CDC provided weekly updates on the number of flu vaccine doses distributed, vaccination coverage estimates for children, and the number of doses administered in pharmacies and doctor’s offices. Coverage estimates for pregnant women were updated monthly. CDC is exploring non-survey data sources, such as claims and other administrative data, to track flu vaccination coverage.  For example, CDC is exploring ways to estimate within-season influenza vaccination coverage among adults using data on the number of doses administered in pharmacies and doctor’s offices and estimates of the proportion of all influenza vaccinations that are received in these settings.  CDC supports state and local jurisdictions in use of their immunization information systems to assess influenza vaccination coverage at the jurisdictional level. For the 2020-2021 flu season, there were some changes to FluView surveillance methodology. In addition to state-level data, the influenza-like-illness (ILI) activity map displayed ILI activity by Core-based Statistical Areas (CBSA), a U.S. geographic area defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) that consists of one or more counties (or equivalents) anchored by an urban center of at least 10,000 people plus adjacent counties that are socioeconomically tied to the urban center by commuting. Also, during most flu seasons, state and territorial health departments report the level of geographic spread of flu activity in their jurisdictions each week through the State and Territorial Epidemiologists Report. However, because COVID-19 and influenza have similar symptoms and it is difficult to differentiate the two without laboratory testing, reporting for this system was suspended for the 2020-21 influenza season. Finally, NCHS collects death certificate data for all deaths occurring in the United States, and these data are aggregated by the week of death occurrence. In previous flu seasons, the NCHS surveillance data were used to calculate the percent of all deaths occurring each week that had pneumonia and/or influenza (P&I) listed as a cause of death. Because many COVID-19-related deaths also have pneumonia, COVID-19 coded deaths were added to P&I to create the PIC (pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19) classification. PIC includes all deaths with pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19 listed on the death certificate. More information on flu surveillance methodology and these updates is available online. CDC monitors flu deaths each week using death certificate data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). NCHS mortality surveillance data was used in previous years to calculate the percentage of all U.S. deaths occurring each week that had pneumonia and/or influenza (P&I) listed as a cause of death on the death certificate. Pneumonia is included because it is a frequent complication of severe influenza and increases in flu activity are associated with increases in pneumonia deaths. The weekly percentage of P&I deaths is compared to the expected percentage of deaths due to pneumonia to estimate the increase in pneumonia deaths, or excess deaths, due to influenza.  Because pneumonia is also a frequent cause of death among people with COVID-19, COVID-19 coded deaths were added to P&I to create the PIC (pneumonia, influenza and/or COVID-19) mortality classification. CDC has displayed PIC mortality in its FluView report since week 40 of 2020. In addition, to make these data more easily downloadable and interactive, CDC incorporated PIC mortality data into its FluView Interactive data dashboard, an online data resource that accompanies the FluView report. Using FluView Interactive, users can download flu data and view this data via detailed, interactive graphs, charts, maps, and other visualizations.","The number of flu vaccine doses distributed, vaccination coverage estimates for children, and vaccinations administered in retail pharmacies and doctor’s offices were updated weekly.","Influenza vaccination may also contributed to reduced flu illness during the 2020–2021 season.

2021-2022,What was the 2021-2022 flu season like?,"The timing and severity of the 2021-2022 influenza (flu) season was different than most seasons before the COVID-19 pandemic. Though relatively mild, there was more activity during the 2021-2022 flu season than during the 2020-2021 flu season, and activity remained elevated later in the spring than any flu season on record. Nationally, flu activity during the 2021-2022 season began to increase in November and remained elevated until mid-June with two different waves of influenza A(H3N2) virus activity occurring; the first peaked in late December 2021, and the second in April 2022. Prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, flu activity would most commonly begin to increase in October or November and peak in February. Compared with pre-pandemic seasons, flu activity during the 2021-2022 season was elevated much later into the spring with a historically late second national peak in April. While it’s not unusual to have two waves of flu activity during a season, usually the predominant flu virus during each wave is different. The 2021-2022 flu season featured two distinct waves of A(H3N2) viruses. The first wave of activity peaked in mid-December throughout the country, but the timing of peak activity during the second wave varied by region ranging from mid-March through May. Notably, the second wave, which peaked nationally in April, occurred much later than has been previously observed. During the 2021-2022 influenza season, influenza-associated hospitalizations were monitored in two systems: the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET), which covers approximately 9% of the U.S. population, and HHS Protect Hospitalization Surveillance, which consists of reports from all U.S. hospitals. During October 1, 2021, through June 11, 2022, a total of 5,130 laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations were reported by FluSurv-NET sites. Activity occurred in two waves with hospitalization rates first peaking nationally during the week ending January 1, 2022, (week 52) at 1.0 per 100,000 population. The second, slightly higher peak, occurred during the weeks ending April 23 and April 30, 2022 (weeks 16 and 17) with a rate of 1.2 per 100,000 population. The overall cumulative hospitalization rate was 167.5 per 100,000 population with the highest rate among adults aged ≥65 years (50.8), followed by children aged 0–4 years (21.9), adults aged 50-64 years (16.2), children aged 5-17 years (9.0) and adults aged 18-49 (9.1). The majority (96.7%) of influenza-associated hospitalizations, were due to influenza A viruses (99.2% of those subtyped were A(H3N2) viruses). Among those with information about underlying conditions, 93.7% of adults and 65.3% of children reported at least one underlying medical condition.\nFor the 2021-2022 season, HHS Protect Influenza-Associated hospitalizations were added as a component to monitor severe illness associated with influenza. A total of 74,181 influenza-associated hospitalizations were reported between October 3, 2021, and October 1, 2022, and hospitalizations occurred during two waves of activity. The total cumulative influenza-associated hospitalization rate in HHS Protect was 22.6 per 100,000 population. Similar to FluSurv-NET, the first wave peaked nationally during late December (week ending January 1, 2022), and the second, higher peak occurred during mid-April (the week ending April 23, 2022). Regionally, the timing of the second wave peak varied; regions 6 and 7 (Central and South Central) peaked in mid-March, regions 2, 3, and 5 (New York/New Jersey, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest) peaked in April; and regions 1, 4, 8, 9 and 10 (New England, Southeast, Mountain, West Coast and Pacific Northwest) peaked in May. It was estimated that about 5,000 people died from flu in the United States during the 2021-2022 season. CDC estimates deaths in the United States using mathematical modeling. The model used by CDC uses a ratio of deaths to hospitalizations to estimate the total number of influenza-associated deaths from the estimated number of influenza-associated hospitalizations. To estimate the number of influenza-associated hospitalizations that occur in a flu season, CDC looks at how many in-hospital deaths are observed in the FluSurv-NET surveillance system. The in-hospital deaths are then adjusted for under-detection of influenza,. More information is available at How CDC Estimates the Burden of Seasonal Influenza in the U.S. Not all flu-related deaths occur in the hospital, so CDC uses death certificate data to estimate how likely influenza-associated deaths are to occur outside the hospital. CDC looks at death certificates that have pneumonia or influenza causes (P&I), other respiratory and circulatory causes (R&C), or other non-respiratory, non-circulatory causes of death, because deaths related to flu may not have influenza listed as a cause of death. CDC uses information on the causes of death from FluSurv-NET to determine the mixture of P&I, R&C, and other coded deaths to include in its investigation of death certificate data. Finally, once the proportion of influenza-associated deaths that occurred outside of the hospital is estimated, an estimate of the deaths-to-hospitalization ratio is derived from it. During October 3, 2021, through October 1, 2022, 44 laboratory-confirmed flu-associated deaths in children were reported to CDC. Forty-two were associated with an influenza A virus infection and, of the 22 influenza A viruses that were subtyped, all were A(H3N2) viruses. Additionally, there were two cases of influenza B virus infection among the reported pediatric deaths. The average age was 6 years, and 25 (57%) children died after admission to a hospital. Among the 41 children with a known medical history, 25 (61%) had at least one underlying medical condition associated with increased risk for flu-related complications. The number of deaths reported to CDC each year prior to the COVID-19 pandemic ranged from 37 (2011-2012 season) to 199 deaths (2019-2020 season). These data have been reported to CDC since 2004, when deaths in children associated with influenza virus infection became nationally notifiable. It is important to note that the actual number of flu-associated deaths in children is likely to be higher than what is reported by states to CDC because not all flu deaths in children are detected/reported.",It is important to note that the actual number of flu-associated deaths in children is likely to be higher than what is reported by states to CDC because not all flu deaths in children are detected/reported.,"Nationally, flu activity during the 2021-2022 season began to increase in November and remained elevated until mid-June with two different waves of influenza A(H3N2) virus activity occurring; the first peaked in late December 2021, and the second in April 2022.

2021-2022,What flu viruses circulated during the 2021-2022 season?,"The majority of influenza viruses detected during the 2021-2022 flu season were A(H3N2) viruses. Laboratory testing showed the H3N2 viruses that circulated were genetically closely related to the 2021-2022 vaccine virus. While the number of B/Victoria viruses that circulated during the 2021-22 season was small, the majority of the B/Victoria viruses characterized were antigenically similar to the vaccine reference virus. During the 2021-2022 influenza season (October 3, 2021 – October 1, 2022), 13 human infections with novel influenza A virus were identified. Six A(H1N2)v virus infections were identified (one each in California, Georgia, Michigan, Ohio, Oregon and Wisconsin); five A(H3N2)v virus infections were identified (one each in Michigan and Ohio, and three in West Virginia); and one A(H1)v virus infection was identified (Oklahoma). One avian A(H5N1) virus infection was identified in a person in Colorado with exposure to birds infected with a highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus. The A(H5N1) identification was the first positive test for avian influenza A(H5) virus in a human in the United States.",The A(H5N1) identification was the first positive test for avian influenza A(H5) virus in a human in the United States.,The A(H5N1) identification was the first positive test for avian influenza A(H5) virus in a human in the United States.,"Six A(H1N2)v virus infections were identified (one each in California, Georgia, Michigan, Ohio, Oregon and Wisconsin); five A(H3N2)v virus were identified (one each in Michigan and Ohio, and three in West Virginia); and one A(H1)v virus infection was identified (Oklahoma infections).","13 human infections with novel influenza A virus were identified.

2021-2022,What flu viruses did the 2021-2022 flu vaccines protect against?,"For 2021-2022, recommendations were made for egg-based, cell-based, and recombinant flu vaccines as listed below. Egg-based vaccine composition recommendations: Cell- or recombinant-based vaccine composition recommendations: These recommendations included two updates compared with 2020-2021 U.S. flu vaccines. Both the influenza A(H1N1) and the influenza A(H3N2) vaccine virus components were updated. Compared with the Southern Hemisphere flu vaccine recommendation, this recommendation represented one update and that was to the influenza A(H3N2) component. For more information, visit Influenza Vaccine for the 2021-2022 Season | FDAexternal icon For the 2021-2022 flu season, there was no recommended preference for any one vaccine over another, and providers could administer any licensed, age-appropriate flu vaccine (IIV, RIV4, or LAIV4).

2021-2022,How much flu vaccine was produced and distributed during the 2021-2022 season?,"Flu vaccine is provided by private manufacturers, so supply depends on manufacturers. For the 2021-2022 flu season, manufacturers distributed 179.4 million doses of flu vaccine to the U.S. market as of February 25, 2022.  CDC provided weekly updates on total flu vaccine doses distributed throughout the 2020-2021 flu season. Flu vaccine manufacturers did not report any significant delays in national flu vaccine supply or distribution during 2020-2021. Preliminary end-of-season vaccine effectiveness estimates showed that flu vaccines reduced people’s risk of mild to moderate flu illness caused by flu A(H3N2)–the most common flu virus this season–by about one-third (35% overall).\nThe U.S. Flu VE Network collected outpatient data on enrolled children and adults aged 6 months and older with acute respiratory illness (fever and a cough) from October 4, 2021, to April 30, 2022. The study used a test-negative design that compared vaccination odds among influenza positive cases and influenza negative controls that did not include people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Vaccine effectiveness among people 6 months and older against any influenza A virus infection was 34% with a 95% confidence interval of 19% to 46%. These estimates were higher than initial estimates published in “Interim Estimates of 2021– 22 Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness — United States, February 2022”. Preliminary early-season vaccine effectiveness estimates from March 2022 suggested flu vaccines were providing no measurable protection against mild to moderate illness caused by the most common influenza A(H3N2) virus during the 2021-2022 flu season. The earlier estimates were lower than these end-of-season estimates because of the small number of early-season flu cases and bias related to COVID-19 illnesses. In the past, vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 viruses has often been lower than against A(H1N1) and influenza B viruses. These updated preliminary end-of-year vaccine effectiveness estimates are similar to what we have seen against H3N2 viruses in the past. Antiviral resistance means that a virus has changed in such a way that antiviral drugs are less effective or not effective at all in treating or preventing illnesses with that virus. CDC conducts ongoing surveillance and testing of influenza viruses for reduced antiviral susceptibility and resistance among seasonal and novel influenza A viruses, and guidance is updated as needed. CDC assesses susceptibility of influenza viruses to antiviral medications including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir, using next-generation sequence analysis supplemented by other laboratory assays. Information about antiviral susceptibility test methods can be found at U.S. Influenza Surveillance: Purpose and Methods | CDC. The use of adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) is not recommended for treatment and prevention of influenza A virus infection because of persistently high prevalence of resistance among circulating influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H3N2) viruses (the adamantanes are not effective against influenza B viruses).\nDuring the 2021-2022, 0.2% of the viruses tested had markers associated with reduced susceptibility to the antiviral drugs recommended for treatment of influenza by CDC. Resistance to the adamantane class of antiviral drugs remained widespread among influenza A viruses.

2021-2022,What vaccine uptake estimates did CDC provide during the 2021-2022 season?,"CDC’s Weekly Flu Vaccination Dashboard provides preliminary, within-season, weekly influenza vaccination estimates, which are updated during the season as more data become available.  Overall, estimates suggested flu vaccination coverage was lower during the 2021-2022 flu season compared with last season, especially among certain groups at increased risk of flu complications, such as pregnant people and children. A detailed summary of flu vaccination coverage for the 2021-2022 season is available at National Flu Vaccination Dashboard. The dashboard included information on the number of flu vaccine doses distributed in the United States, weekly flu vaccination coverage rates for children ages 6 months to 17 years old, monthly flu vaccination coverage rates among pregnant persons, vaccine coverage data by race and ethnicity, and information on how many flu vaccines were administered in pharmacies and doctor’s offices. The data were updated weekly or monthly, depending on the source, throughout the 2021-2022 influenza season. Visit the National Influenza Vaccination Dashboard for more information. Flu vaccination coverage among children was assessed through the National Immunization Survey-Flu (NIS-Flu), which provided weekly flu vaccination coverage estimates for children ages 6 months to 17 years old. NIS-Flu is a national random-digit-dialed cellular telephone survey of households conducted during the flu season (October-June). Additional information about NIS-Flu methods and estimates from 2019-2020 season are available at FluVaxView. Monthly flu vaccination coverage estimates among pregnant people are based on electronic health record (EHR) data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), a collaboration between CDC’s Immunization Safety Office and nine integrated health care organizations. Of note, because these estimates are based on data from nine integrated health care systems, they may not be representative of all pregnant people in the United States. CDC tracked the number of flu vaccines administered at pharmacies and doctor’s offices by using new sources of vaccination data, including IQVIA data for vaccinations administered in retail pharmacies (e.g., chain, mass merchandise, food stores, and independent pharmacies) and doctor’s offices. The first estimates of flu vaccine uptake for the 2021-22 season were posted on Weekly Flu Vaccination Dashboard | FluVaxView | Seasonal Influenza (Flu) | CDC on October 7, 2021. For each flu season since 2009-2010, CDC has estimated annual flu vaccination coverage for the United States by using data from several nationally representative surveys: the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), and the National Immunization Survey-Flu (NIS-Flu). Internet panel surveys of adults, health care personnel, and pregnant people are also used. CDC will continue to provide end of season estimates of influenza vaccination coverage from these data sources. For the 2021-22 flu season, CDC provided weekly updates on the number of flu vaccine doses distributed, vaccination coverage estimates for children, and the number of doses administered in pharmacies and doctor’s offices. Coverage estimates for pregnant people were updated monthly.",Additional information about NIS-Flu methods and estimates from 2019-2020 season are available at FluVaxView.,"CDC’s Weekly Flu Vaccination Dashboard provides preliminary, within-season, weekly influenza vaccination estimates, which are updated during the season as more data become available.

2021-2022,Were there any updates in the methods for flu surveillance for 2021-2022?,"During the 2021-2022 flu season, there were a few changes to CDC’s network of influenza surveillance systems compared with the 2020-2021 season. CDC added another surveillance system, the HHS Protect Hospitalization Surveillance System, that tracks flu hospitalizations in the United States. Hospitals in all 50 states and U.S. territories are reporting on laboratory testing, capacity and utilization, and patient flows for COVID-19 and number of influenza admissions to the hospital and the ICU. This system is designed to facilitate the public health response to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and gathers information on influenza positive admissions. The detailed list of reported data elements is provided here. CDC also added a surveillance system that tracks influenza in long-term care facility (LTCF) residents through the NHSN Long-term Care Facility  COVID-19 Module. CMS-certified LTCFs from all 50 states and U.S. territories report COVID-19 and influenza positive test results among residents and staff and personal protective equipment (PPE) supply data to CDC’s NHSN. Influenza data elements include the number of residents and number of staff/personnel with new laboratory-confirmed influenza.  The number of LTCFs reporting at least one influenza case among residents to CDC’s NHSN and the number of facilities reporting each week are reported at the national and HHS region level. Finally, CDC retired the map depicting “State and Territorial Epidemiologists Reports of Geographic Spread of Flu.” This map had been used to capture an assessment of the geographic spread influenza within each state and jurisdiction. This weekly estimate was suspended for the 2020-2021 flu season because the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the data systems used to generate those estimates. Testing practices and health care seeking behaviors were so different that the previous seasons methods/definitions would not have worked. After discussions with public health partners during the summer of 2021, the decision was made to permanently retire this surveillance component due in part to the fact that the systems used to determine the level of spread remain significantly altered by changes in healthcare seeking behavior and testing changes brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, and a measure of geographic spread was not necessary anymore given improvements in national influenza surveillance systems in recent years. These improvements include more testing, new surveillance system components, and presenting more data at the state level and sub-state level. More information on flu surveillance methodology and these updates is available online.",More information on flu surveillance methodology and these updates is available online.,"Hospitals in all 50 states and U.S. territories are reporting on laboratory testing, capacity and utilization, and patient flows for COVID-19 and number of influenza admissions to the hospital and the ICU.

2023-2024,Updates to U.S. Flu Surveillance Methods for the 2023-2024 Season,"Starting with the 2023-2024 influenza season, the percentage of deaths with influenza listed on the death certificate will be displayed in FluView. P&I (pneumonia and/or influenza) no longer measures the impact of influenza in the same way it had prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the PIC (pneumonia, influenza and/or COVID) measure is largely being driven COVID-19 activity making it difficult to monitor the impact of influenza using that measure. Although monitoring influenza-only coded deaths will underestimate the full impact of influenza mortality, this measure allows for tracking trends in the impact of influenza on mortality and is not as influenced by COVID-19 as the other two measures. More information about U.S. influenza surveillance is available. Most health care insurance plans cover the annual flu shot as preventive care.

2023-2024,B/Yamagata and Flu Vaccines Summary,"Quadrivalent flu vaccines protect against four different influenza viruses: one H1N1 virus, one H3N2 virus, one B/Victoria virus and one B/Yamagata virus. All current flu vaccines in the United States are quadrivalent vaccines. For many years, these four kinds of viruses circulated most commonly among people. However, CDC and global surveillance data show that B/Yamagata lineage viruses have not been detected since March 2020. Because these B/Yamagata viruses are not actively circulating in people, the risk of infection with B/Yamagata lineage viruses is considered to be low at this time. These surveillance data were reviewed by the World Health Organization Influenza Vaccine Composition Advisory Committee (September 29, 2023) and the U.S. FDA Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) (October 5, 2023). Based on these data, these committees recommended that B/Yamagata lineage antigens be removed from flu vaccines for use in the United States and internationally as soon as reasonably possible. The same data was presented to the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP) on October 26, 2023. CDC is not involved in regulatory decision-making, including for flu vaccines, but will make a recommendation on the use of flu vaccine for 2024-2025 season once VRBPAC has selected the viruses for inclusion in U.S. 2024-2025 flu vaccines. In the meantime, CDC will continue to conduct surveillance to track circulating influenza viruses, including whether any B/Yamagata viruses are detected. U.S. quadrivalent flu vaccines for the 2023-2024 (current) season include B/Yamagata lineage viruses. The exact timing for removal of B/Yamagata lineage components from flu vaccines has not yet been decided. Trivalent flu vaccines are formulated to protect against three flu viruses (an A(H1N1) virus, an A(H3N2) virus, and a B/Victoria virus). Trivalent flu vaccines are approved for use in many countries. Both trivalent and quadrivalent flu vaccines are expected to offer similar protection against the flu viruses they protect against. B/Yamagata flu viruses have not circulated in the population since March 2020, so protection from trivalent and quadrivalent flu vaccines is expected to be similar. All flu vaccines for the 2024-2025 season are anticipated to be trivalent in the United States. More information is available on trivalent flu vaccines.","CDC is not involved in regulatory decision-making, including for flu vaccines, but will make a recommendation on the use of flu vaccine for 2024-2025 season once VRBPAC has selected the viruses for inclusion in U.S. 2024-2025 flu vaccines.","Quadrivalent flu vaccines protect against four different influenza viruses: one H1N1 virus, one H3N2 virus, one B/Victoria virus and one B/Yamagata virus.
