      "What’s new this flu season? A few things are new this season: Flu vaccines have been updated to better match circulating viruses [the B/Victoria component was changed and the influenza A(H3N2) component was updated]. For the 2018-2019 season, the nasal spray flu vaccine (live attenuated influenza vaccine or “LAIV”) is again a recommended option for influenza vaccination of persons for whom it is otherwise appropriate. The nasal spray is approved for use in non-pregnant individuals, 2 to 49 years old. There is a precaution against the use of LAIV for people with certain underlying medical conditions. All LAIV will be quadrivalent (four-component). Most regular-dose egg-based flu shots will be quadrivalent. All recombinant vaccine will be quadrivalent. (No trivalent recombinant vaccine will be available this season.) Cell-grown flu vaccine will be quadrivalent. For this vaccine, the influenza A(H3N2) and both influenza B reference viruses will be cell-derived, and the influenza A(H1N1) will be egg-derived. All these reference viruses will be grown in cells to produce the components of Flucelvax. No intradermal flu vaccine will be available. The age recommendation for “Fluarix Quadrivalent” was changed from 3 years and older to 6 months and older after the annual recommendations were published last season to be consistent with Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved labeling. The age recommendation for Afluria Quadrivalent was changed from 18 years and older to 5 years and older after the annual recommendations were published last season to be consistent with Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved labeling. Baloxavir marboxil (trade name Xofluza®) is a new influenza single-dose antiviral drug approved October 24, 2018 by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Baloxavir is approved for the treatment of acute uncomplicated flu in people 12 years and older who have had flu symptoms for less than 48 hours. More information is available: Influenza Antiviral Drug Baloxavir Marboxil. CDC is reporting in-season estimates of the cumulative number of flu illnesses, medical visits and hospitalizations in the U.S. These Preliminary In-Season Burden Estimates will be updated weekly over the course of the flu season. What flu vaccines are recommended this season? For the 2018-2019 flu season, providers may choose to administer any licensed, age-appropriate flu vaccine (IIV, RIV4, or LAIV4). Options this season include: Standard dose flu shots. These are given into the muscle. They are usually given with a needle, but two (Afluria and Afluria Quadrivalent) can be given to some people (those 18 to 64 years old) with a jet injector. High-dose shots for older people. Shots made with adjuvant for older people. Shots made with virus grown in cell culture. Shots made using a vaccine production technology (recombinant vaccine) that does not require the use of flu virus. Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) – or the nasal spray vaccine – is also an option for use during the 2018-2019 season for persons whom it is otherwise appropriate. There is a table showing all flu vaccines that are FDA-approved for use in the United States during the 2018-2019 season. What viruses will the 2018-2019 flu vaccines protect against? There are many different flu viruses and they are constantly changing. The composition of U.S. flu vaccines is reviewed annually and updated as needed to match circulating flu viruses. Flu vaccines protect against the three or four viruses (depending on vaccine) that research suggests will be most common. For 2018-2019, trivalent (three-component) vaccines are recommended to contain: A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 A(H3N2)-like virus (updated) B/Colorado/06/2017-like (Victoria lineage) virus (updated) Quadrivalent (four-component) vaccines, which protect against a second lineage of B viruses, are recommended to contain: the three recommended viruses above, plus B/Phuket/3073/2013-like (Yamagata lineage) virus When should I get vaccinated? You should get a flu vaccine before flu begins spreading in your community. It takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies that protect against flu to develop in the body, so make plans to get vaccinated early in fall, before flu season begins. CDC recommends that people get a flu vaccine by the end of October. Getting vaccinated later, however, can still be beneficial and vaccination should continue to be offered throughout flu season, even into January or later. Children who need two doses of vaccine to be protected should start the vaccination process sooner, because the two doses must be given at least four weeks apart. Can I get a flu vaccine if I am allergic to eggs? The recommendations for people with egg allergies are the same as last season. People who have experienced only hives after exposure to egg can get any licensed flu vaccine that is otherwise appropriate for their age and health. People who have symptoms other than hives after exposure to eggs, such as angioedema, respiratory distress, lightheadedness, or recurrent emesis; or who have needed epinephrine or another emergency medical intervention, can also get any licensed flu vaccine that is otherwise appropriate for their age and health, but the vaccine should be given in a medical setting and be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic conditions. (Settings include hospitals, clinics, health departments, and physician offices). People with egg allergies no longer have to wait 30 minutes after receiving their vaccine. Implications of Cell-Based Vaccines Why is it significant that cell-grown vaccine reference viruses are used to produce some components of one type of flu vaccine? Cell-grown reference viruses do not have the changes that are present in egg-grown reference viruses, so they should be more similar to circulating “wild-type” viruses. Vaccine effectiveness depends in part on the match between the vaccine virus and circulating flu viruses. Is flu vaccine made using a cell-grown reference virus and cell-based technology more effective than vaccine made using an egg-grown reference virus and egg-based technology? While the use of cell-grown reference viruses and cell-based technology may offer the potential for better protection over traditional, egg-based flu vaccines because they result in vaccine viruses that are more similar to flu viruses in circulation, there are no data yet to support this. There is no preferential recommendation for one injectable flu vaccine over another. Top of Page Flu Activity What sort of flu season is expected this year? It is not possible to predict what this flu season will be like. While flu spreads every year, the timing, severity, and length of the season varies from one season to another. Will new flu viruses circulate this season? Flu viruses are constantly changing so it’s not unusual for new flu viruses to appear each year. More information about how flu viruses change is available. Will the United States have a flu epidemic? The United States experiences annual epidemics of seasonal flu. This time of year is called “flu season.” In the United States, flu viruses are most common during the fall and winter months. Influenza activity often begins to increase in October and November. Most of the time flu activity peaks between December and February, and it can last as late as May. CDC monitors certain key flu indicators (for example, outpatient visits of influenza-like illness (ILI), the results of laboratory testing and reports of flu hospitalizations and deaths). When these indicators rise and remain elevated for a number of consecutive weeks, “flu season” is said to have begun. Usually ILI increases first, followed by an increase in flu-associated hospitalizations, which is then followed by increases in flu-associated deaths. For the most current influenza surveillance information: Weekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report. When will flu activity begin and when will it peak? The timing of flu is unpredictable and can vary in different parts of the country and from season to season. Seasonal flu viruses can be detected year-round; however, seasonal flu activity often begins as early as October and November and can continue to occur as late as May. Flu activity most commonly peaks in the United States between December and February. How many people get sick with flu every year? CDC conducts surveillance for people who see their health care provider for flu-like illness through the Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet); a network of thousands of health care providers who report the proportion of patients seeking care for flu-like illness weekly to CDC. This system allows CDC to track levels of medically attended flu-like illness over the course of the flu season. CDC does not know exactly how many people get sick with seasonal flu each year. There are several reasons for this including that ILINet does not include every health care provider and monitors flu-like illness, not laboratory-confirmed influenza cases. Also, flu illness is not a reportable disease and not everyone who gets sick with flu seeks medical care or gets tested. CDC uses mathematical modeling in combination with data from traditional flu surveillance systems to estimate the numbers of flu illnesses in the United States. CDC estimates that flu has resulted in between 9.3 million and 49 million illnesses each year in the United States since 2010. More information on these estimates is available on CDC’s Disease Burden of Influenza page. During the 2018-2019 flu season, CDC began reporting cumulative, in-season estimates of the disease burden of influenza, including estimates of the total number of flu illnesses in the United States. More information regarding these Preliminary In-Season Burden Estimates is available. For more information on CDC surveillance systems, see CDC’s Overview of Influenza Surveillance in the United States. How many people are hospitalized from flu every year? CDC conducts surveillance for flu-related hospitalizations through the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET), a collaboration between CDC, the Emerging Infections Program, and additional Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Project (IHSP) states in 13 geographically distributed areas in the United States. The network includes hospitals that serve roughly 9 percent of the U.S. population. The data collected through FluSurv-NET allows CDC to calculate an overall hospitalization rate, as well as by age group, but this system does not provide the total number of flu hospitalizations that actually occur in the United States. Reported FluSurv-NET hospitalization rates are adjusted to correct for under-detection, which is calculated from the percent of persons hospitalized with respiratory illness who were tested for influenza and the average sensitivity of influenza tests used in the participating FluSurv-NET surveillance hospitals. CDC uses these methods to estimate the true burden of flu hospitalizations in the United States. Since 2010, CDC estimates that flu has resulted in between 140,000 and 960,000 hospitalizations each year. For more information on these estimates see CDC’s Disease Burden of Influenza page. During the 2018-2019 flu season, CDC began reporting cumulative, in-season estimates of disease burden of influenza, including estimates of the total number of people hospitalized in the United States from flu. More information regarding these Preliminary In-Season Burden Estimates is available. For more information on CDC surveillance systems, see CDC’s Overview of Influenza Surveillance in the United States. How many adults die from flu each year? Flu deaths in adults are not nationally notifiable. In order to monitor influenza related deaths in all age groups, CDC tracks pneumonia and influenza (P&I)–attributed deaths through the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Mortality Reporting System. This system tracks the proportion of death certificates processed that list pneumonia or influenza as the underlying or contributing cause of death. This system provides an overall indication of whether flu-associated deaths are elevated, but does not provide an exact number of how many people died from flu. As it does for the numbers of flu cases, doctor’s visits and hospitalizations, CDC also estimates deaths in the United States using mathematical modeling. CDC estimates that from 2010-2011 to 2017-2018, influenza-associated deaths in the United States ranged from a low of 12,000 (during 2011-2012) to a high of 79,000 (during 2017-2018). The model used to estimate flu-associated deaths uses a ratio of deaths-to-hospitalizations in order to estimate the total flu-related deaths during a season. For more information: How CDC Estimates Burden. As data allow, CDC will begin reporting cumulative, in-season estimates of the influenza mortality burden. More information regarding these Preliminary In-Season Burden Estimates is available. For more information: Overview of Influenza Surveillance in the United States, “Mortality Surveillance.” How many children die from flu each year? Influenza-associated deaths in children (people younger than 18) became nationally reportable in 2004. Since that time the number of pediatric flu deaths reported to CDC each year has ranged from 37 (2011-2012 season) to 185 deaths (2017-2018 season). It’s important to note that the actual number of flu deaths in children is thought to be higher than what is reported by states to CDC because not all flu deaths in children are detected/reported. CDC also estimates the numbers of flu-related deaths using statistical models. Estimates of deaths in children since 2010 have ranged from 37 (2011-2012) to about 1,200 (2012-2013). CDC believes these estimated numbers of pediatric deaths are likely a better estimate of the number of pediatric flu deaths. For more information on these estimates see CDC’s Disease Burden of Influenza page. Why is it difficult to know exactly how many people die from flu? There are several factors that make it difficult to determine accurate numbers of deaths caused by flu regardless of reporting. Some of the challenges in counting flu associated deaths include the following: the sheer volume of deaths to be counted; the lack of testing (not everyone that dies with an influenza-like illness is tested for influenza); and the different coding of deaths (influenza-associated deaths often are a result of complications secondary to underlying medical problems, and this may be difficult to sort out). For more information: Estimating Seasonal Influenza-Associated Deaths in the United States. Top of Page Protective Actions What should I do to protect myself from flu this season? CDC recommends a yearly flu vaccine for everyone 6 months of age and older as the first and most important step in protecting against this serious disease. In addition to getting a seasonal flu vaccine, you can take everyday preventive actions like staying away from sick people and washing your hands to reduce the spread of germs. If you are sick with flu, stay home from work or school to prevent spreading flu to others. In addition, there are prescription medications called antiviral drugs that can be used to treat influenza illness. What should I do to protect my loved ones from flu this season? Encourage your loved ones to get vaccinated. Vaccination is especially important for people at high risk for developing flu complications, and their close contacts. Also, if you have a loved one who is at high risk of flu complications and they develop flu symptoms, encourage them to get a medical evaluation for possible treatment with flu antiviral drugs. These drugs work best if given within 48 hours of when symptoms start. CDC recommends that people who are at high risk for serious flu complications and who get flu symptoms during flu season be treated with flu antiviral drugs as quickly as possible without waiting for confirmatory testing. People who are not at high risk for serious flu complications may also be treated with flu antiviral drugs, especially if treatment can begin within 48 hours. Do some children require two doses of flu vaccine? Yes. Some children 6 months through 8 years of age will require two doses of flu vaccine for adequate protection from flu. Children in this age group who are getting vaccinated for the first time will need two doses of flu vaccine, spaced at least 4 weeks apart. Children who have only received one dose in their lifetime also need two doses. Your child’s doctor or other health care professional can tell you if your child needs two doses of flu vaccine. What can I do to protect children who are too young to get vaccinated? Children younger than 6 months old are at high risk of serious flu complications, but are too young to get a flu vaccine. Because of this, safeguarding them from flu is especially important. If you live with or care for an infant younger than 6 months old, you should get a flu vaccine to help protect them from flu. Advice for Caregivers of Young Children is available for more information. Everyone else who is around the baby also should be vaccinated. Also, studies have shown that flu vaccination of the mother during pregnancy can protect the baby after birth from flu infection for several months. In addition to getting vaccinated, you and your loved ones can take everyday preventive actions like staying away from sick people and washing your hands to reduce the spread of germs. If you are sick with flu, stay home from work or school to prevent spreading flu to others. Top of Page Vaccine and Vaccination How much flu vaccine will be available this season? Flu vaccine is produced by private manufacturers, so supply depends on manufacturers. For the 2018-2019 season, manufacturers projected they would provide between 163 million and 168 million doses of injectable vaccine for the U.S. market. (Projections may change as the season progresses.) Flu vaccine supply updates will be provided as they become available at Seasonal Influenza Vaccine & Total Doses Distributed. Are any of the available flu vaccines recommended over the others? For the 2018-2019 flu season, ACIP recommends annual influenza vaccination for everyone 6 months and older with any licensed, age-appropriate flu vaccine (IIV, RIV4, or LAIV4) with no preference expressed for any one vaccine over another. There are many vaccine options to choose from; the most important thing is for all people 6 months and older to get a flu vaccine every year. If you have questions about which vaccine is best for you, talk to your doctor or other health care professional. Why is the nasal spray being recommended as an option this year when it has been shown to not be effective in past flu seasons? While observational data from 2010-11 through 2015-16 flu seasons indicate that LAIV was not effective among 2 through 17-year-olds against H1N1pdm09 influenza viruses in the U.S., LAIV was effective against influenza B viruses, and was similarly effective to inactivated influenza vaccines against H3N2 viruses. Some data suggest that the new H1N1 vaccine virus included in the new LAIV vaccines will have improved effectiveness against circulating H1N1 viruses; however, no published effectiveness estimates are available yet. When should I get vaccinated? Getting vaccinated before flu activity begins helps protect you once flu season starts in your community. It takes about two weeks after vaccination for the body’s immune response to fully respond and for you to be protected, so make plans to get vaccinated. CDC recommends that people get a flu vaccine by the end of October. However, getting vaccinated later can still be beneficial. CDC recommends ongoing flu vaccination as long as influenza viruses are circulating, even into January or later. Children 6 months to 8 years old who need two doses of vaccine should get the first dose as soon after vaccine is available to allow time to get the second dose before the start of flu season. The two doses should be given at least 4 weeks apart. Where can I get a flu vaccine? Flu vaccines are offered by many doctor’s offices, clinics, health departments, pharmacies and college health centers, as well as by many employers, and even by some schools. Even if you don’t have a regular doctor or nurse, you can get a flu vaccine somewhere else, like a health department, pharmacy, urgent care clinic, and often your school, college health center, or work. The HealthMap Vaccine Finder helps you to locate where you can get a flu vaccine. What is flu vaccination using a jet injector? The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved two influenza vaccines (Afluria and Afluria Quadrivalent) for administration by a jet injector device (the PharmaJet Stratis 0.5ml Needle-free Jet Injector) for people 18 through 64 years of age. These are the only two influenza vaccines approved for administration by jet injector. People aged 18 through 64 years may receive these vaccines either by jet injector or needle. A jet injector is a medical device used for vaccination that uses a high-pressure, narrow stream of fluid to penetrate the skin instead of a hypodermic needle. More information about Flu Vaccination by Jet Injector is available. What is adjuvanted flu vaccine? The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed a seasonal influenza (flu) vaccine containing adjuvant for adults 65 years of age and older. An adjuvant is an ingredient added to a vaccine to create a stronger immune response to vaccination. FLUAD was licensed in November 2015 and will be available during the 2018-2019 flu season. It contains the MF59 adjuvant, an oil-in-water emulsion of squalene oil. FLUAD™ is the first adjuvanted seasonal flu vaccine marketed in the United States. How long does a flu vaccine protect me from getting flu? Multiple studies conducted over different seasons and across flu vaccine types and influenza virus subtypes have shown that the body’s immunity to influenza viruses (acquired either through natural infection or vaccination) declines over time. The decline in antibodies is influenced by several factors, including the antigen used in the vaccine, the age of the person being vaccinated, and the person’s general health (for example, certain chronic health conditions may have an impact on immunity). Older people and others with weakened immune systems may not generate the same amount of antibodies after vaccination; further, their antibody levels may drop more quickly when compared to young, healthy people. Getting vaccinated each year provides the best protection against flu throughout flu season. It’s important to get a flu vaccine every season, even if you got vaccinated the season before and the viruses in the flu vaccine have not changed for the current season. Can I get vaccinated and still get the flu? Yes. It’s possible to get sick with flu even if you have been vaccinated (although you won’t know for sure unless you get a flu test). This is possible for the following reasons: You may be exposed to a flu virus shortly before getting vaccinated or during the period that it takes the body to gain protection after getting vaccinated. This exposure may result in you becoming ill with flu before the vaccine begins to protect you. (Antibodies that provide protection develop in the body about 2 weeks after vaccination.) You may be exposed to a flu virus that is not included in the seasonal flu vaccine. There are many different flu viruses that circulate every year. A flu vaccine is made to protect against the three or four flu viruses that research suggests will be most common. Unfortunately, some people can become infected with a flu virus a flu vaccine is designed to protect against, despite getting vaccinated. Protection provided by flu vaccination can vary widely, based in part on health and age factors of the person getting vaccinated. In general, a flu vaccine works best among healthy younger adults and older children. Some older people and people with certain chronic illnesses may develop less immunity after vaccination. Flu vaccination is not a perfect tool, but it is the best way to protect against flu infection. Top of Page Flu Vaccine Effectiveness How effective will flu vaccines be this season? Influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) can vary from season to season and among different age and risk groups and even by vaccine type. How well the vaccine works can depend in part on the match between the vaccine viruses used to produce vaccine and circulating viruses that season. It’s not possible to predict in advance what flu viruses will predominate. CDC monitors circulating viruses throughout the year and provides new and updated information about their similarity to flu vaccine viruses as it becomes available. Information is published weekly in FluView and summarized at intervals in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Vaccine effectiveness estimates are also provided when they become available. While vaccine effectiveness can vary, recent studies show vaccine reduces the risk of flu illness by about 40% to 60% among the overall population during seasons when most circulating flu viruses are like the vaccine viruses. Similar reductions against hospitalization have been observed too. More information about previous vaccine effectiveness, is available. Will this season’s flu vaccine be a good match for circulating viruses? It’s not possible to predict with certainty if a flu vaccine will be a good match for circulating flu viruses. A flu vaccine is made to protect against the flu viruses that research and surveillance indicate will likely be most common during the season. However, experts must pick which flu viruses to include in a flu vaccine many months in advance in order for flu vaccines to be produced and delivered on time. Also flu viruses change constantly (called “drift”). They can change from one season to the next or they can even change within the course of one flu season. Another factor that can impact vaccine effectiveness, especially against influenza A(H3N2) viruses, are changes that can occur in vaccine viruses as they are grown in eggs, which is the production method for most current flu vaccines. Because of these factors, there is always the possibility of a less than optimal match between circulating flu viruses and the viruses in a flu vaccine. Over the course of flu season, CDC studies samples of circulating flu viruses to evaluate how close a match there is between viruses used to make the flu vaccine and circulating flu viruses. One of the ways that helps CDC evaluate the match between flu vaccine viruses and circulating flu viruses is with a lab process called ‘genetic and antigenic characterization’. Results of genetic and antigenic characterization testing are published weekly in CDC’s FluView. Can a flu vaccine provide protection even if the flu vaccine is not a “good” match? Yes, antibodies made in response to vaccination with one flu virus can sometimes provide protection against different but related flu viruses. A less than ideal match may result in reduced vaccine effectiveness against the flu virus that is different from what is in the flu vaccine, but it might still provide some protection against flu illness. In addition, it’s important to remember that a flu vaccine contains three or four flu viruses (depending on the type of vaccine you receive) so that even when there is a less than ideal match or lower effectiveness against one virus, a flu vaccine may protect against the other flu viruses. For these reasons, even during seasons when there is a less than ideal match, CDC continues to recommend flu vaccination for everyone 6 months and older. Vaccination is particularly important for people at high risk for serious flu complications, and their close contacts. Top of Page If You Get Sick What happens in the body when someone has flu? Influenza viruses usually infect the respiratory tract (i.e., the airways of the nose, throat and lungs). As the infection progresses, the body’s immune system responds to fight the virus. This results in inflammation that can trigger respiratory symptoms such as cough and sore throat. The immune system response can also trigger fever and cause muscle or body aches. When infected persons cough, sneeze, or talk, they can spread influenza viruses in respiratory droplets to people who are nearby. People might also get flu by touching a contaminated surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth or nose. Most people who become sick will recover in a few days to less than two weeks, but some people may become more severely ill. Following flu infection, moderate complications such as secondary ear and sinus infections can occur. Pneumonia is a serious flu complication that can result from either influenza virus infection alone or from co-infection of flu virus and bacteria. Other possible serious complications triggered by flu can include inflammation of the heart (myocarditis), brain (encephalitis) or muscle (myositis, rhabdomyolysis) tissues, and multi-organ failure (for example, respiratory and kidney failure). Severe complications can happen to anyone, but may be more likely to happen to people who have certain chronic medical conditions, or in elderly persons. What should I do if I get sick with flu? Most people with flu have mild illness and do not need medical care or antiviral drugs. If you get sick with flu symptoms, in most cases, you should stay home and avoid contact with other people except to get medical care. If, however, you have symptoms of flu and are at high risk of flu complications, or are very sick or concerned about your illness, contact your health care provider. There are drugs your doctor may prescribe for treating flu called antivirals. These drugs can make you better faster and may also prevent serious complications. Antiviral drugs are prescription drugs that can be used to treat flu illness. People at high risk of serious flu complications recommended for prompt antiviral treatment include children younger than 2 years of age (although all children younger than 5 years are considered at higher risk for complications from influenza, the highest risk is for those younger than 2 years of age), adults 65 years of age and older, pregnant women, people with certain long-term medical conditions, and residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities). Antiviral treatment as early as possible is also recommended for people who are very sick with flu (such as those with complicated, progressive illness or people hospitalized because of flu). Other people can be treated with antivirals at their health care professional’s discretion. Treating high risk people or people who are very sick with flu with antiviral drugs is very important. Studies show that prompt treatment with antiviral drugs can prevent serious flu complications. Prompt treatment can mean the difference between having a milder illness versus very serious illness that could result in a hospital stay. Treatment with antivirals works best when begun within 48 hours of getting sick, but can still be beneficial when given later in the course of illness. Antiviral drugs are effective across all age and risk groups. Studies show that antiviral drugs are under-prescribed for people who are at high risk of complications who get flu. Four FDA-approved antiviral medications are recommended for use during the 2018-2019 flu season: oseltamivir (available in generic versions and under the trade name Tamiflu®), zanamivir (Relenza®), peramivir (Rapivab®), and baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza®). More information about antiviral drugs can be found at Treatment – Antiviral Drugs. This guidance is consistent with the 2018-2019 flu season recommendations published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) on December 19 in Clinical Infectious Diseases. “The Flu: What To Do If You Get Sick” What is baloxavir marboxil? Baloxavir marboxil (trade name Xofluza®) is an influenza single-dose antiviral drug approved October 24, 2018 by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Baloxavir is approved for the treatment of acute uncomplicated flu in people 12 years and older who have had flu symptoms for less than 48 hours. In clinical randomized trials, baloxavir was similar to oseltamivir, a currently recommended flu antiviral drug, in alleviating flu symptoms. More information regarding baloxaviris available: Influenza Antiviral Drug Baloxavir Marboxil. Top of Page Surveillance How does CDC track flu activity? The Epidemiology and Prevention Branch in the Influenza Division at CDC collects, compiles and analyzes information on flu activity year round in the United States and produces FluView, a weekly influenza surveillance report, and FluView Interactive, which allows for more in-depth exploration of influenza surveillance data. The U.S. influenza surveillance system is a collaborative effort between CDC and its many partners in state, local, and territorial health departments, public health and clinical laboratories, vital statistics offices, healthcare providers, clinics, and emergency departments. Information in five categories is collected from eight different data sources that allow CDC to: Find out when and where influenza activity is occurring Track influenza-related illness Determine what influenza viruses are circulating Detect changes in influenza viruses Measure the impact influenza is having on hospitalizations and deaths in the United States For more information, visit “Overview of Influenza Surveillance in the United States”. What will CDC do to monitor flu vaccine effectiveness for the 2018-2019 season? CDC collaborates with partners each season to assess how well the seasonal flu vaccines are working. During the 2018-2019 season, CDC is planning multiple studies on the effectiveness of flu shots. These studies measure vaccine effectiveness in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza among persons 6 months of age and older. A summary of CDC’s latest vaccine effectiveness estimates is available at Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness, 2005-2018. What is CDC doing to monitor antiviral resistance in the United States during the 2018-2019 season? Antiviral resistance means that a virus has changed in such a way that antiviral drugs are less effective or not effective at all in treating or preventing illnesses with that virus. CDC will continue to collect and monitor flu viruses for changes through an established network of domestic and global surveillance systems. CDC also is working with the state public health departments and the World Health Organization to collect additional information on antiviral resistance in the United States and worldwide. The information collected will assist in making informed recommendations regarding use of antiviral drugs to treat influenza. How does CDC estimate the burden of seasonal flu on the United States? The burden of influenza on the United States can vary widely from season to season and is determined by a number of factors including the characteristics of circulating viruses, the timing of the season, population immunity to circulating viruses, how well flu vaccines are working, and how many people have gotten vaccinated. While the impact of flu varies, it places a substantial burden on the health of people in the United States each year. CDC uses a model to estimate the numbers of influenza illnesses, medical visits, and hospitalizations in the United States (as well as the impact of influenza vaccination on these numbers). The same model is also extended to estimate flu-related deaths in the United States. This methodology has been used to retroactively calculate influenza burden, including deaths, going back to 2010. Starting with the 2018-2019 flu season, CDC will report cumulative, in-season estimates of the burden of influenza. These Preliminary In-Season Burden Estimates will be updated weekly over the course of the flu season. How does CDC classify flu season severity? In 2017, CDC adopted and outlined a new methodology for determining flu season severity. Based on data from past flu seasons, CDC researchers used key flu indicator data to develop intensity thresholds (ITs) to classify the severity of flu seasons. Based on the intensity thresholds, CDC researchers classified seasonal severity from 2003-2004 through the 2017-2018 flu seasons. Overall, four seasons were classified as low severity, seven as moderate, two as high, and none as very high. What is flu forecasting? Influenza (flu) places a significant disease burden on the U.S. population each year, but the magnitude and timing varies from season to season, making the annual impact difficult to predict at the beginning of each season. Flu forecasting can change that by predicting in advance when the start, peak, and increases in flu activity will occur. Unlike CDC’s traditional influenza surveillance systems, which measure influenza activity after it has occurred, flu forecasting offers the possibility to look into the future and better plan ahead, potentially reducing the impact of flu. \n",

approved for the treatment of acute uncomplicated flu in people 12 years and older who have had flu symptoms for less than 48 hours More information is available Influenza Antiviral Drug Baloxavir Marboxil CDC is reporting inseason estimates of the cumulative number of flu illnesses medical visits and hospitalizations in the US These Preliminary InSeason Burden Estimates will be updated weekly over the course of the flu season What flu vaccines are recommended this season For the 20182019 flu season providers may choose to administer any licensed ageappropriate flu vaccine IIV RIV4 or LAIV4 Options this season include Standard dose flu shots These are given into the muscle They are usually given with a needle but two Afluria and Afluria Quadrivalent can be given to some people those 18 to 64 years old with a jet injector Highdose shots for older people Shots made with adjuvant for older people Shots made with virus grown in cell culture Shots made using a vaccine production technology recombinant vaccine that does not require the use of flu virus Live attenuated influenza vaccine LAIV  or the nasal spray vaccine  is also an option for use during the 20182019 season for persons whom it is otherwise appropriate There is a table showing all flu vaccines that are FDAapproved for use in the United States during the 20182019 season What viruses will the 20182019 flu vaccines protect against There are many different flu viruses and they are constantly changing The composition of US flu vaccines is reviewed annually and updated as needed to match circulating flu viruses Flu vaccines protect against the three or four viruses depending on vaccine that research suggests will be most common For 20182019 trivalent threecomponent vaccines are recommended to contain AMichigan452015 H1N1pdm09like virus ASingaporeINFIMH1600192016 AH3N2like virus updated BColorado062017like Victoria lineage virus updated Quadrivalent fourcomponent vaccines which protect against a second lineage of B viruses are recommended to contain the three recommended viruses above plus BPhuket30732013like Yamagata lineage virus When should I get vaccinated You should get a flu vaccine before flu begins spreading in your community It takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies that protect against flu to develop in the body so make plans to get vaccinated early in fall before flu season begins CDC recommends that people get a flu vaccine by the end of October Getting vaccinated later however can still be beneficial and vaccination should continue to be offered throughout flu season even into January or later Children who need two doses of vaccine to be protected should start the vaccination process sooner because the two doses must be given at least four weeks apart Can I get a flu vaccine if I am allergic to eggs The recommendations for people with egg allergies are the same as last season People who have experienced only hives after exposure to egg can get any licensed flu vaccine that is otherwise appropriate for their age and health People who have symptoms other than hives after exposure to eggs such as angioedema respiratory distress lightheadedness or recurrent emesis or who have needed epinephrine or another emergency medical intervention can also get any licensed flu vaccine that is otherwise appropriate for their age and health but the vaccine should be given in a medical setting and be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic conditions Settings include hospitals clinics health departments and physician offices People with egg allergies no longer have to wait 30 minutes after receiving their vaccine Implications of CellBased Vaccines Why is it significant that cellgrown vaccine reference viruses are used to produce some components of one type of flu vaccine Cellgrown reference viruses do not have the changes that are present in egggrown reference viruses so they should be more similar to circulating wildtype viruses Vaccine effectiveness depends in part on the match between the vaccine virus and circulating flu viruses Is flu vaccine made using a cellgrown reference virus and cellbased technology more effective than vaccine made using an egggrown reference virus and eggbased technology While the use of cellgrown reference viruses and cellbased technology may offer the potential for better protection over traditional eggbased flu vaccines because they result in vaccine viruses that are more similar to flu viruses in circulation there are no data yet to support this There is no preferential recommendation for one injectable flu vaccine over another Top of Page Flu Activity What sort of flu season is expected this year It is not possible to predict what this flu season will be like While flu spreads every year the timing severity and length of the season varies from one season to another Will new flu viruses circulate this season Flu viruses are constantly changing so its not unusual for new flu viruses to appear each year More information about how flu viruses change is available Will the United States have a flu epidemic The United States experiences annual epidemics of seasonal flu This time of year is called flu season In the United States flu viruses are most common during the fall and winter months Influenza activity often begins to increase in October and November Most of the time flu activity peaks between December and February and it can last as late as May CDC monitors certain key flu indicators for example outpatient visits of influenzalike illness ILI the results of laboratory testing and reports of flu hospitalizations and deaths When these indicators rise and remain elevated for a number of consecutive weeks flu season is said to have begun Usually ILI increases first followed by an increase in fluassociated hospitalizations which is then followed by increases in fluassociated deaths For the most current influenza surveillance information Weekly US Influenza Surveillance Report When will flu activity begin and when will it peak The timing of flu is unpredictable and can vary in different parts of the country and from season to season Seasonal flu viruses can be detected yearround however seasonal flu activity often begins as early as October and November and can continue to occur as late as May Flu activity most commonly peaks in the United States between December and February How many people get sick with flu every year CDC conducts surveillance for people who see their health care provider for flulike illness through the Outpatient Influenzalike Illness Surveillance Network ILINet a network of thousands of health care providers who report the proportion of patients seeking care for flulike illness weekly to CDC This system allows CDC to track levels of medically attended flulike illness over the course of the flu season CDC does not know exactly how many people get sick with seasonal flu each year There are several reasons for this including that ILINet does not include every health care provider and monitors flulike illness not laboratoryconfirmed influenza cases Also flu illness is not a reportable disease and not everyone who gets sick with flu seeks medical care or gets tested CDC uses mathematical modeling in combination with data from traditional flu surveillance systems to estimate the numbers of flu illnesses in the United States CDC estimates that flu has resulted in between 93 million and 49 million illnesses each year in the United States since 2010 More information on these estimates is available on CDCs Disease Burden of Influenza page During the 20182019 flu season CDC began reporting cumulative inseason estimates of the disease burden of influenza including estimates of the total number of flu illnesses in the United States More information regarding these Preliminary InSeason Burden Estimates is available For more information on CDC surveillance systems see CDCs Overview of Influenza Surveillance in the United States How many people are hospitalized from flu every year CDC conducts surveillance for flurelated hospitalizations through the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network FluSurvNET a collaboration between CDC the Emerging Infections Program and additional Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Project IHSP states in 13 geographically distributed areas in the United States The network includes hospitals that serve roughly 9 percent of the US population The data collected through FluSurvNET allows CDC to calculate an overall hospitalization rate as well as by age group but this system does not provide the total number of flu hospitalizations that actually occur in the United States Reported FluSurvNET hospitalization rates are adjusted to correct for underdetection which is calculated from the percent of persons hospitalized with respiratory illness who were tested for influenza and the average sensitivity of influenza tests used in the participating FluSurvNET surveillance hospitals CDC uses these methods to estimate the true burden of flu hospitalizations in the United States Since 2010 CDC estimates that flu has resulted in between 140000 and 960000 hospitalizations each year For more information on these estimates see CDCs Disease Burden of Influenza page During the 20182019 flu season CDC began reporting cumulative inseason estimates of disease burden of influenza including estimates of the total number of people hospitalized in the United States from flu More information regarding these Preliminary InSeason Burden Estimates is available For more information on CDC surveillance systems see CDCs Overview of Influenza Surveillance in the United States How many adults die from flu each year Flu deaths in adults are not nationally notifiable In order to monitor influenza related deaths in all age groups CDC tracks pneumonia and influenza PIattributed deaths through the National Center for Health Statistics NCHS Mortality Reporting System This system tracks the proportion of death certificates processed that list pneumonia or influenza as the underlying or contributing cause of death This system provides an overall indication of whether fluassociated deaths are elevated but does not provide an exact number of how many people died from flu As it does for the numbers of flu cases doctors visits and hospitalizations CDC also estimates deaths in the United States using mathematical modeling CDC estimates that from 20102011 to 20172018 influenzaassociated deaths in the United States ranged from a low of 12000 during 20112012 to a high of 79000 during 20172018 The model used to estimate fluassociated deaths uses a ratio of deathstohospitalizations in order to estimate the total flurelated deaths during a season For more information How CDC Estimates Burden As data allow CDC will begin reporting cumulative inseason estimates of the influenza mortality burden More information regarding these Preliminary InSeason Burden Estimates is available For more information Overview of Influenza Surveillance in the United States Mortality Surveillance How many children die from flu each year Influenzaassociated deaths in children people younger than 18 became nationally reportable in 2004 Since that time the number of pediatric flu deaths reported to CDC each year has ranged from 37 20112012 season to 185 deaths 20172018 season Its important to note that the actual number of flu deaths in children is thought to be higher than what is reported by states to CDC because not all flu deaths in children are detectedreported CDC also estimates the numbers of flurelated deaths using statistical models Estimates of deaths in children since 2010 have ranged from 37 20112012 to about 1200 20122013 CDC believes these estimated numbers of pediatric deaths are likely a better estimate of the number of pediatric flu deaths For more information on these estimates see CDCs Disease Burden of Influenza page Why is it difficult to know exactly how many people die from flu There are several factors that make it difficult to determine accurate numbers of deaths caused by flu regardless of reporting Some of the challenges in counting flu associated deaths include the following the sheer volume of deaths to be counted the lack of testing not everyone that dies with an influenzalike illness is tested for influenza and the different coding of deaths influenzaassociated deaths often are a result of complications secondary to underlying medical problems and this may be difficult to sort out For more information Estimating Seasonal InfluenzaAssociated Deaths in the United States Top of Page Protective Actions What should I do to protect myself from flu this season CDC recommends a yearly flu vaccine for everyone 6 months of age and older as the first and most important step in protecting against this serious disease In addition to getting a seasonal flu vaccine you can take everyday preventive actions like staying away from sick people and washing your hands to reduce the spread of germs If you are sick with flu stay home from work or school to prevent spreading flu to others In addition there are prescription medications called antiviral drugs that can be used to treat influenza illness What should I do to protect my loved ones from flu this season Encourage your loved ones to get vaccinated Vaccination is especially important for people at high risk for developing flu complications and their close contacts Also if you have a loved one who is at high risk of flu complications and they develop flu symptoms encourage them to get a medical evaluation for possible treatment with flu antiviral drugs These drugs work best if given within 48 hours of when symptoms start CDC recommends that people who are at high risk for serious flu complications and who get flu symptoms during flu season be treated with flu antiviral drugs as quickly as possible without waiting for confirmatory testing People who are not at high risk for serious flu complications may also be treated with flu antiviral drugs especially if treatment can begin within 48 hours Do some children require two doses of flu vaccine Yes Some children 6 months through 8 years of age will require two doses of flu vaccine for adequate protection from flu Children in this age group who are getting vaccinated for the first time will need two doses of flu vaccine spaced at least 4 weeks apart Children who have only received one dose in their lifetime also need two doses Your childs doctor or other health care professional can tell you if your child needs two doses of flu vaccine What can I do to protect children who are too young to get vaccinated Children younger than 6 months old are at high risk of serious flu complications but are too young to get a flu vaccine Because of this safeguarding them from flu is especially important If you live with or care for an infant younger than 6 months old you should get a flu vaccine to help protect them from flu Advice for Caregivers of Young Children is available for more information Everyone else who is around the baby also should be vaccinated Also studies have shown that flu vaccination of the mother during pregnancy can protect the baby after birth from flu infection for several months In addition to getting vaccinated you and your loved ones can take everyday preventive actions like staying away from sick people and washing your hands to reduce the spread of germs If you are sick with flu stay home from work or school to prevent spreading flu to others Top of Page Vaccine and Vaccination How much flu vaccine will be available this season Flu vaccine is produced by private manufacturers so supply depends on manufacturers For the 20182019 season manufacturers projected they would provide between 163 million and 168 million doses of injectable vaccine for the US market Projections may change as the season progresses Flu vaccine supply updates will be provided as they become available at Seasonal Influenza Vaccine  Total Doses Distributed Are any of the available flu vaccines recommended over the others For the 20182019 flu season ACIP recommends annual influenza vaccination for everyone 6 months and older with any licensed ageappropriate flu vaccine IIV RIV4 or LAIV4 with no preference expressed for any one vaccine over another There are many vaccine options to choose from the most important thing is for all people 6 months and older to get a flu vaccine every year If you have questions about which vaccine is best for you talk to your doctor or other health care professional Why is the nasal spray being recommended as an option this year when it has been shown to not be effective in past flu seasons While observational data from 201011 through 201516 flu seasons indicate that LAIV was not effective among 2 through 17yearolds against H1N1pdm09 influenza viruses in the US LAIV was effective against influenza B viruses and was similarly effective to inactivated influenza vaccines against H3N2 viruses Some data suggest that the new H1N1 vaccine virus included in the new LAIV vaccines will have improved effectiveness against circulating H1N1 viruses however no published effectiveness estimates are available yet When should I get vaccinated Getting vaccinated before flu activity begins helps protect you once flu season starts in your community It takes about two weeks after vaccination for the bodys immune response to fully respond and for you to be protected so make plans to get vaccinated CDC recommends that people get a flu vaccine by the end of October However getting vaccinated later can still be beneficial CDC recommends ongoing flu vaccination as long as influenza viruses are circulating even into January or later Children 6 months to 8 years old who need two doses of vaccine should get the first dose as soon after vaccine is available to allow time to get the second dose before the start of flu season The two doses should be given at least 4 weeks apart Where can I get a flu vaccine Flu vaccines are offered by many doctors offices clinics health departments pharmacies and college health centers as well as by many employers and even by some schools Even if you dont have a regular doctor or nurse you can get a flu vaccine somewhere else like a health department pharmacy urgent care clinic and often your school college health center or work The HealthMap Vaccine Finder helps you to locate where you can get a flu vaccine What is flu vaccination using a jet injector The US Food and Drug Administration FDA has approved two influenza vaccines Afluria and Afluria Quadrivalent for administration by a jet injector device the PharmaJet Stratis 05ml Needlefree Jet Injector for people 18 through 64 years of age These are the only two influenza vaccines approved for administration by jet injector People aged 18 through 64 years may receive these vaccines either by jet injector or needle A jet injector is a medical device used for vaccination that uses a highpressure narrow stream of fluid to penetrate the skin instead of a hypodermic needle More information about Flu Vaccination by Jet Injector is available What is adjuvanted flu vaccine The US Food and Drug Administration FDA licensed a seasonal influenza flu vaccine containing adjuvant for adults 65 years of age and older An adjuvant is an ingredient added to a vaccine to create a stronger immune response to vaccination FLUAD was licensed in November 2015 and will be available during the 20182019 flu season It contains the MF59 adjuvant an oilinwater emulsion of squalene oil FLUAD is the first adjuvanted seasonal flu vaccine marketed in the United States How long does a flu vaccine protect me from getting flu Multiple studies conducted over different seasons and across flu vaccine types and influenza virus subtypes have shown that the bodys immunity to influenza viruses acquired either through natural infection or vaccination declines over time The decline in antibodies is influenced by several factors including the antigen used in the vaccine the age of the person being vaccinated and the persons general health for example certain chronic health conditions may have an impact on immunity Older people and others with weakened immune systems may not generate the same amount of antibodies after vaccination further their antibody levels may drop more quickly when compared to young healthy people Getting vaccinated each year provides the best protection against flu throughout flu season Its important to get a flu vaccine every season even if you got vaccinated the season before and the viruses in the flu vaccine have not changed for the current season Can I get vaccinated and still get the flu Yes Its possible to get sick with flu even if you have been vaccinated although you wont know for sure unless you get a flu test This is possible for the following reasons You may be exposed to a flu virus shortly before getting vaccinated or during the period that it takes the body to gain protection after getting vaccinated This exposure may result in you becoming ill with flu before the vaccine begins to protect you Antibodies that provide protection develop in the body about 2 weeks after vaccination You may be exposed to a flu virus that is not included in the seasonal flu vaccine There are many different flu viruses that circulate every year A flu vaccine is made to protect against the three or four flu viruses that research suggests will be most common Unfortunately some people can become infected with a flu virus a flu vaccine is designed to protect against despite getting vaccinated Protection provided by flu vaccination can vary widely based in part on health and age factors of the person getting vaccinated In general a flu vaccine works best among healthy younger adults and older children Some older people and people with certain chronic illnesses may develop less immunity after vaccination Flu vaccination is not a perfect tool but it is the best way to protect against flu infection Top of Page Flu Vaccine Effectiveness How effective will flu vaccines be this season Influenza vaccine effectiveness VE can vary from season to season and among different age and risk groups and even by vaccine type How well the vaccine works can depend in part on the match between the vaccine viruses used to produce vaccine and circulating viruses that season Its not possible to predict in advance what flu viruses will predominate CDC monitors circulating viruses throughout the year and provides new and updated information about their similarity to flu vaccine viruses as it becomes available Information is published weekly in FluView and summarized at intervals in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report MMWR Vaccine effectiveness estimates are also provided when they become available While vaccine effectiveness can vary recent studies show vaccine reduces the risk of flu illness by about 40 to 60 among the overall population during seasons when most circulating flu viruses are like the vaccine viruses Similar reductions against hospitalization have been observed too More information about previous vaccine effectiveness is available Will this seasons flu vaccine be a good match for circulating viruses Its not possible to predict with certainty if a flu vaccine will be a good match for circulating flu viruses A flu vaccine is made to protect against the flu viruses that research and surveillance indicate will likely be most common during the season However experts must pick which flu viruses to include in a flu vaccine many months in advance in order for flu vaccines to be produced and delivered on time Also flu viruses change constantly called drift They can change from one season to the next or they can even change within the course of one flu season Another factor that can impact vaccine effectiveness especially against influenza AH3N2 viruses are changes that can occur in vaccine viruses as they are grown in eggs which is the production method for most current flu vaccines Because of these factors there is always the possibility of a less than optimal match between circulating flu viruses and the viruses in a flu vaccine Over the course of flu season CDC studies samples of circulating flu viruses to evaluate how close a match there is between viruses used to make the flu vaccine and circulating flu viruses One of the ways that helps CDC evaluate the match between flu vaccine viruses and circulating flu viruses is with a lab process called genetic and antigenic characterization Results of genetic and antigenic characterization testing are published weekly in CDCs FluView Can a flu vaccine provide protection even if the flu vaccine is not a good match Yes antibodies made in response to vaccination with one flu virus can sometimes provide protection against different but related flu viruses A less than ideal match may result in reduced vaccine effectiveness against the flu virus that is different from what is in the flu vaccine but it might still provide some protection against flu illness In addition its important to remember that a flu vaccine contains three or four flu viruses depending on the type of vaccine you receive so that even when there is a less than ideal match or lower effectiveness against one virus a flu vaccine may protect against the other flu viruses For these reasons even during seasons when there is a less than ideal match CDC continues to recommend flu vaccination for everyone 6 months and older Vaccination is particularly important for people at high risk for serious flu complications and their close contacts Top of Page If You Get Sick What happens in the body when someone has flu Influenza viruses usually infect the respiratory tract ie the airways of the nose throat and lungs As the infection progresses the bodys immune system responds to fight the virus This results in inflammation that can trigger respiratory symptoms such as cough and sore throat The immune system response can also trigger fever and cause muscle or body aches When infected persons cough sneeze or talk they can spread influenza viruses in respiratory droplets to people who are nearby People might also get flu by touching a contaminated surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth or nose Most people who become sick will recover in a few days to less than two weeks but some people may become more severely ill Following flu infection moderate complications such as secondary ear and sinus infections can occur Pneumonia is a serious flu complication that can result from either influenza virus infection alone or from coinfection of flu virus and bacteria Other possible serious complications triggered by flu can include inflammation of the heart myocarditis brain encephalitis or muscle myositis rhabdomyolysis tissues and multiorgan failure for example respiratory and kidney failure Severe complications can happen to anyone but may be more likely to happen to people who have certain chronic medical conditions or in elderly persons What should I do if I get sick with flu Most people with flu have mild illness and do not need medical care or antiviral drugs If you get sick with flu symptoms in most cases you should stay home and avoid contact with other people except to get medical care If however you have symptoms of flu and are at high risk of flu complications or are very sick or concerned about your illness contact your health care provider There are drugs your doctor may prescribe for treating flu called antivirals These drugs can make you better faster and may also prevent serious complications Antiviral drugs are prescription drugs that can be used to treat flu illness People at high risk of serious flu complications recommended for prompt antiviral treatment include children younger than 2 years of age although all children younger than 5 years are considered at higher risk for complications from influenza the highest risk is for those younger than 2 years of age adults 65 years of age and older pregnant women people with certain longterm medical conditions and residents of nursing homes and other longterm care facilities Antiviral treatment as early as possible is also recommended for people who are very sick with flu such as those with complicated progressive illness or people hospitalized because of flu Other people can be treated with antivirals at their health care professionals discretion Treating high risk people or people who are very sick with flu with antiviral drugs is very important Studies show that prompt treatment with antiviral drugs can prevent serious flu complications Prompt treatment can mean the difference between having a milder illness versus very serious illness that could result in a hospital stay Treatment with antivirals works best when begun within 48 hours of getting sick but can still be beneficial when given later in the course of illness Antiviral drugs are effective across all age and risk groups Studies show that antiviral drugs are underprescribed for people who are at high risk of complications who get flu Four FDAapproved antiviral medications are recommended for use during the 20182019 flu season oseltamivir available in generic versions and under the trade name Tamiflu zanamivir Relenza peramivir Rapivab and baloxavir marboxil Xofluza More information about antiviral drugs can be found at Treatment  Antiviral Drugs This guidance is consistent with the 20182019 flu season recommendations published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America IDSA on December 19 in Clinical Infectious Diseases The Flu What To Do If You Get Sick What is baloxavir marboxil Baloxavir marboxil trade name Xofluza is an influenza singledose antiviral drug approved October 24 2018 by the Food and Drug Administration FDA Baloxavir is approved for the treatment of acute uncomplicated flu in people 12 years and older who have had flu symptoms for less than 48 hours In clinical randomized trials baloxavir was similar to oseltamivir a currently recommended flu antiviral drug in alleviating flu symptoms More information regarding baloxaviris available Influenza Antiviral Drug Baloxavir Marboxil Top of Page Surveillance How does CDC track flu activity The Epidemiology and Prevention Branch in the Influenza Division at CDC collects compiles and analyzes information on flu activity year round in the United States and produces FluView a weekly influenza surveillance report and FluView Interactive which allows for more indepth exploration of influenza surveillance data The US influenza surveillance system is a collaborative effort between CDC and its many partners in state local and territorial health departments public health and clinical laboratories vital statistics offices healthcare providers clinics and emergency departments Information in five categories is collected from eight different data sources that allow CDC to Find out when and where influenza activity is occurring Track influenzarelated illness Determine what influenza viruses are circulating Detect changes in influenza viruses Measure the impact influenza is having on hospitalizations and deaths in the United States For more information visit Overview of Influenza Surveillance in the United States What will CDC do to monitor flu vaccine effectiveness for the 20182019 season CDC collaborates with partners each season to assess how well the seasonal flu vaccines are working During the 20182019 season CDC is planning multiple studies on the effectiveness of flu shots These studies measure vaccine effectiveness in preventing laboratoryconfirmed influenza among persons 6 months of age and older A summary of CDCs latest vaccine effectiveness estimates is available at Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness 20052018 What is CDC doing to monitor antiviral resistance in the United States during the 20182019 season Antiviral resistance means that a virus has changed in such a way that antiviral drugs are less effective or not effective at all in treating or preventing illnesses with that virus CDC will continue to collect and monitor flu viruses for changes through an established network of domestic and global surveillance systems CDC also is working with the state public health departments and the World Health Organization to collect additional information on antiviral resistance in the United States and worldwide The information collected will assist in making informed recommendations regarding use of antiviral drugs to treat influenza How does CDC estimate the burden of seasonal flu on the United States The burden of influenza on the United States can vary widely from season to season and is determined by a number of factors including the characteristics of circulating viruses the timing of the season population immunity to circulating viruses how well flu vaccines are working and how many people have gotten vaccinated While the impact of flu varies it places a substantial burden on the health of people in the United States each year CDC uses a model to estimate the numbers of influenza illnesses medical visits and hospitalizations in the United States as well as the impact of influenza vaccination on these numbers The same model is also extended to estimate flurelated deaths in the United States This methodology has been used to retroactively calculate influenza burden including deaths going back to 2010 Starting with the 20182019 flu season CDC will report cumulative inseason estimates of the burden of influenza These Preliminary InSeason Burden Estimates will be updated weekly over the course of the flu season How does CDC classify flu season severity In 2017 CDC adopted and outlined a new methodology for determining flu season severity Based on data from past flu seasons CDC researchers used key flu indicator data to develop intensity thresholds ITs to classify the severity of flu seasons Based on the intensity thresholds CDC researchers classified seasonal severity from 20032004 through the 20172018 flu seasons Overall four seasons were classified as low severity seven as moderate two as high and none as very high What is flu forecasting Influenza flu places a significant disease burden on the US population each year but the magnitude and timing varies from season to season making the annual impact difficult to predict at the beginning of each season Flu forecasting can change that by predicting in advance when the start peak and increases in flu activity will occur Unlike CDCs traditional influenza surveillance systems which measure influenza activity after it has occurred flu forecasting offers the possibility to look into the future and better plan ahead potentially reducing the impact of flu \n"

      "Whats new this flu season A few things are new this season Flu vaccines have been updated to better match circulating viruses the BVictoria component was changed and the influenza AH3N2 component was updated For the 20182019 season the nasal spray flu vaccine live attenuated influenza vaccine or LAIV is again a recommended option for influenza vaccination of persons for whom it is otherwise appropriate The nasal spray is approved for use in nonpregnant individuals 2 to 49 years old There is a precaution against the use of LAIV for people with certain underlying medical conditions All LAIV will be quadrivalent fourcomponent Most regulardose eggbased flu shots will be quadrivalent All recombinant vaccine will be quadrivalent No trivalent recombinant vaccine will be available this season Cellgrown flu vaccine will be quadrivalent For this vaccine the influenza AH3N2 and both influenza B reference viruses will be cellderived and the influenza AH1N1 will be eggderived All these reference viruses will be grown in cells to produce the components of Flucelvax No intradermal flu vaccine will be available The age recommendation for Fluarix Quadrivalent was changed from 3 years and older to 6 months and older after the annual recommendations were published last season to be consistent with Food and Drug Administration FDAapproved labeling The age recommendation for Afluria Quadrivalent was changed from 18 years and older to 5 years and older after the annual recommendations were published last season to be consistent with Food and Drug Administration FDAapproved labeling Baloxavir marboxil trade name Xofluza is a new influenza singledose antiviral drug approved October 24 2018 by the Food and Drug Administration FDA Baloxavir is

Marboxil CDC is reporting inseason estimates of the cumulative number of flu illnesses medical visits and hospitalizations in the US These Preliminary InSeason Burden Estimates will be updated weekly over the course of the flu season What flu vaccines are recommended this season For the 20182019 flu season providers may choose to administer any licensed ageappropriate flu vaccine IIV RIV4 or LAIV4 Options this season include Standard dose flu shots These are given into the muscle They are usually given with a needle but two Afluria and Afluria Quadrivalent can be given to some people those 18 to 64 years old with a jet injector Highdose shots for older people Shots made with adjuvant for older people Shots made with virus grown in cell culture Shots made using a vaccine production technology recombinant vaccine that does not require the use of flu virus Live attenuated influenza vaccine LAIV  or the nasal spray vaccine  is also an option for use during the 20182019 season for persons whom it is otherwise appropriate There is a table showing all flu vaccines that are FDAapproved for use in the United States during the 20182019 season What viruses will the 20182019 flu vaccines protect against There are many different flu viruses and they are constantly changing The composition of US flu vaccines is reviewed annually and updated as needed to match circulating flu viruses Flu vaccines protect against the three or four viruses depending on vaccine that research suggests will be most common For 20182019 trivalent threecomponent vaccines are recommended to contain AMichigan452015 H1N1pdm09like virus ASingaporeINFIMH1600192016 AH3N2like virus updated BColorado062017like Victoria lineage virus updated Quadrivalent fourcomponent vaccines which protect against a second lineage of B viruses are recommended to contain the three recommended viruses above plus BPhuket30732013like Yamagata lineage virus When should I get vaccinated You should get a flu vaccine before flu begins spreading in your community It takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies that protect against flu to develop in the body so make plans to get vaccinated early in fall before flu season begins CDC recommends that people get a flu vaccine by the end of October Getting vaccinated later however can still be beneficial and vaccination should continue to be offered throughout flu season even into January or later Children who need two doses of vaccine to be protected should start the vaccination process sooner because the two doses must be given at least four weeks apart Can I get a flu vaccine if I am allergic to eggs The recommendations for people with egg allergies are the same as last season People who have experienced only hives after exposure to egg can get any licensed flu vaccine that is otherwise appropriate for their age and health People who have symptoms other than hives after exposure to eggs such as angioedema respiratory distress lightheadedness or recurrent emesis or who have needed epinephrine or another emergency medical intervention can also get any licensed flu vaccine that is otherwise appropriate for their age and health but the vaccine should be given in a medical setting and be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic conditions Settings include hospitals clinics health departments and physician offices People with egg allergies no longer have to wait 30 minutes after receiving their vaccine Implications of CellBased Vaccines Why is it significant that cellgrown vaccine reference viruses are used to produce some components of one type of flu vaccine Cellgrown reference viruses do not have the changes that are present in egggrown reference viruses so they should be more similar to circulating wildtype viruses Vaccine effectiveness depends in part on the match between the vaccine virus and circulating flu viruses Is flu vaccine made using a cellgrown reference virus and cellbased technology more effective than vaccine made using an egggrown reference virus and eggbased technology While the use of cellgrown reference viruses and cellbased technology may offer the potential for better protection over traditional eggbased flu vaccines because they result in vaccine viruses that are more similar to flu viruses in circulation there are no data yet to support this There is no preferential recommendation for one injectable flu vaccine over another Top of Page Flu Activity What sort of flu season is expected this year It is not possible to predict what this flu season will be like While flu spreads every year the timing severity and length of the season varies from one season to another Will new flu viruses circulate this season Flu viruses are constantly changing so its not unusual for new flu viruses to appear each year More information about how flu viruses change is available Will the United States have a flu epidemic The United States experiences annual epidemics of seasonal flu This time of year is called flu season In the United States flu viruses are most common during the fall and winter months Influenza activity often begins to increase in October and November Most of the time flu activity peaks between December and February and it can last as late as May CDC monitors certain key flu indicators for example outpatient visits of influenzalike illness ILI the results of laboratory testing and reports of flu hospitalizations and deaths When these indicators rise and remain elevated for a number of consecutive weeks flu season is said to have begun Usually ILI increases first followed by an increase in fluassociated hospitalizations which is then followed by increases in fluassociated deaths For the most current influenza surveillance information Weekly US Influenza Surveillance Report When will flu activity begin and when will it peak The timing of flu is unpredictable and can vary in different parts of the country and from season to season Seasonal flu viruses can be detected yearround however seasonal flu activity often begins as early as October and November and can continue to occur as late as May Flu activity most commonly peaks in the United States between December and February How many people get sick with flu every year CDC conducts surveillance for people who see their health care provider for flulike illness through the Outpatient Influenzalike Illness Surveillance Network ILINet a network of thousands of health care providers who report the proportion of patients seeking care for flulike illness weekly to CDC This system allows CDC to track levels of medically attended flulike illness over the course of the flu season CDC does not know exactly how many people get sick with seasonal flu each year There are several reasons for this including that ILINet does not include every health care provider and monitors flulike illness not laboratoryconfirmed influenza cases Also flu illness is not a reportable disease and not everyone who gets sick with flu seeks medical care or gets tested CDC uses mathematical modeling in combination with data from traditional flu surveillance systems to estimate the numbers of flu illnesses in the United States CDC estimates that flu has resulted in between 93 million and 49 million illnesses each year in the United States since 2010 More information on these estimates is available on CDCs Disease Burden of Influenza page During the 20182019 flu season CDC began reporting cumulative inseason estimates of the disease burden of influenza including estimates of the total number of flu illnesses in the United States More information regarding these Preliminary InSeason Burden Estimates is available For more information on CDC surveillance systems see CDCs Overview of Influenza Surveillance in the United States How many people are hospitalized from flu every year CDC conducts surveillance for flurelated hospitalizations through the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network FluSurvNET a collaboration between CDC the Emerging Infections Program and additional Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Project IHSP states in 13 geographically distributed areas in the United States The network includes hospitals that serve roughly 9 percent of the US population The data collected through FluSurvNET allows CDC to calculate an overall hospitalization rate as well as by age group but this system does not provide the total number of flu hospitalizations that actually occur in the United States Reported FluSurvNET hospitalization rates are adjusted to correct for underdetection which is calculated from the percent of persons hospitalized with respiratory illness who were tested for influenza and the average sensitivity of influenza tests used in the participating FluSurvNET surveillance hospitals CDC uses these methods to estimate the true burden of flu hospitalizations in the United States Since 2010 CDC estimates that flu has resulted in between 140000 and 960000 hospitalizations each year For more information on these estimates see CDCs Disease Burden of Influenza page During the 20182019 flu season CDC began reporting cumulative inseason estimates of disease burden of influenza including estimates of the total number of people hospitalized in the United States from flu More information regarding these Preliminary InSeason Burden Estimates is available For more information on CDC surveillance systems see CDCs Overview of Influenza Surveillance in the United States How many adults die from flu each year Flu deaths in adults are not nationally notifiable In order to monitor influenza related deaths in all age groups CDC tracks pneumonia and influenza PIattributed deaths through the National Center for Health Statistics NCHS Mortality Reporting System This system tracks the proportion of death certificates processed that list pneumonia or influenza as the underlying or contributing cause of death This system provides an overall indication of whether fluassociated deaths are elevated but does not provide an exact number of how many people died from flu As it does for the numbers of flu cases doctors visits and hospitalizations CDC also estimates deaths in the United States using mathematical modeling CDC estimates that from 20102011 to 20172018 influenzaassociated deaths in the United States ranged from a low of 12000 during 20112012 to a high of 79000 during 20172018 The model used to estimate fluassociated deaths uses a ratio of deathstohospitalizations in order to estimate the total flurelated deaths during a season For more information How CDC Estimates Burden As data allow CDC will begin reporting cumulative inseason estimates of the influenza mortality burden More information regarding these Preliminary InSeason Burden Estimates is available For more information Overview of Influenza Surveillance in the United States Mortality Surveillance How many children die from flu each year Influenzaassociated deaths in children people younger than 18 became nationally reportable in 2004 Since that time the number of pediatric flu deaths reported to CDC each year has ranged from 37 20112012 season to 185 deaths 20172018 season Its important to note that the actual number of flu deaths in children is thought to be higher than what is reported by states to CDC because not all flu deaths in children are detectedreported CDC also estimates the numbers of flurelated deaths using statistical models Estimates of deaths in children since 2010 have ranged from 37 20112012 to about 1200 20122013 CDC believes these estimated numbers of pediatric deaths are likely a better estimate of the number of pediatric flu deaths For more information on these estimates see CDCs Disease Burden of Influenza page Why is it difficult to know exactly how many people die from flu There are several factors that make it difficult to determine accurate numbers of deaths caused by flu regardless of reporting Some of the challenges in counting flu associated deaths include the following the sheer volume of deaths to be counted the lack of testing not everyone that dies with an influenzalike illness is tested for influenza and the different coding of deaths influenzaassociated deaths often are a result of complications secondary to underlying medical problems and this may be difficult to sort out For more information Estimating Seasonal InfluenzaAssociated Deaths in the United States Top of Page Protective Actions What should I do to protect myself from flu this season CDC recommends a yearly flu vaccine for everyone 6 months of age and older as the first and most important step in protecting against this serious disease In addition to getting a seasonal flu vaccine you can take everyday preventive actions like staying away from sick people and washing your hands to reduce the spread of germs If you are sick with flu stay home from work or school to prevent spreading flu to others In addition there are prescription medications called antiviral drugs that can be used to treat influenza illness What should I do to protect my loved ones from flu this season Encourage your loved ones to get vaccinated Vaccination is especially important for people at high risk for developing flu complications and their close contacts Also if you have a loved one who is at high risk of flu complications and they develop flu symptoms encourage them to get a medical evaluation for possible treatment with flu antiviral drugs These drugs work best if given within 48 hours of when symptoms start CDC recommends that people who are at high risk for serious flu complications and who get flu symptoms during flu season be treated with flu antiviral drugs as quickly as possible without waiting for confirmatory testing People who are not at high risk for serious flu complications may also be treated with flu antiviral drugs especially if treatment can begin within 48 hours Do some children require two doses of flu vaccine Yes Some children 6 months through 8 years of age will require two doses of flu vaccine for adequate protection from flu Children in this age group who are getting vaccinated for the first time will need two doses of flu vaccine spaced at least 4 weeks apart Children who have only received one dose in their lifetime also need two doses Your childs doctor or other health care professional can tell you if your child needs two doses of flu vaccine What can I do to protect children who are too young to get vaccinated Children younger than 6 months old are at high risk of serious flu complications but are too young to get a flu vaccine Because of this safeguarding them from flu is especially important If you live with or care for an infant younger than 6 months old you should get a flu vaccine to help protect them from flu Advice for Caregivers of Young Children is available for more information Everyone else who is around the baby also should be vaccinated Also studies have shown that flu vaccination of the mother during pregnancy can protect the baby after birth from flu infection for several months In addition to getting vaccinated you and your loved ones can take everyday preventive actions like staying away from sick people and washing your hands to reduce the spread of germs If you are sick with flu stay home from work or school to prevent spreading flu to others Top of Page Vaccine and Vaccination How much flu vaccine will be available this season Flu vaccine is produced by private manufacturers so supply depends on manufacturers For the 20182019 season manufacturers projected they would provide between 163 million and 168 million doses of injectable vaccine for the US market Projections may change as the season progresses Flu vaccine supply updates will be provided as they become available at Seasonal Influenza Vaccine  Total Doses Distributed Are any of the available flu vaccines recommended over the others For the 20182019 flu season ACIP recommends annual influenza vaccination for everyone 6 months and older with any licensed ageappropriate flu vaccine IIV RIV4 or LAIV4 with no preference expressed for any one vaccine over another There are many vaccine options to choose from the most important thing is for all people 6 months and older to get a flu vaccine every year If you have questions about which vaccine is best for you talk to your doctor or other health care professional Why is the nasal spray being recommended as an option this year when it has been shown to not be effective in past flu seasons While observational data from 201011 through 201516 flu seasons indicate that LAIV was not effective among 2 through 17yearolds against H1N1pdm09 influenza viruses in the US LAIV was effective against influenza B viruses and was similarly effective to inactivated influenza vaccines against H3N2 viruses Some data suggest that the new H1N1 vaccine virus included in the new LAIV vaccines will have improved effectiveness against circulating H1N1 viruses however no published effectiveness estimates are available yet When should I get vaccinated Getting vaccinated before flu activity begins helps protect you once flu season starts in your community It takes about two weeks after vaccination for the bodys immune response to fully respond and for you to be protected so make plans to get vaccinated CDC recommends that people get a flu vaccine by the end of October However getting vaccinated later can still be beneficial CDC recommends ongoing flu vaccination as long as influenza viruses are circulating even into January or later Children 6 months to 8 years old who need two doses of vaccine should get the first dose as soon after vaccine is available to allow time to get the second dose before the start of flu season The two doses should be given at least 4 weeks apart Where can I get a flu vaccine Flu vaccines are offered by many doctors offices clinics health departments pharmacies and college health centers as well as by many employers and even by some schools Even if you dont have a regular doctor or nurse you can get a flu vaccine somewhere else like a health department pharmacy urgent care clinic and often your school college health center or work The HealthMap Vaccine Finder helps you to locate where you can get a flu vaccine What is flu vaccination using a jet injector The US Food and Drug Administration FDA has approved two influenza vaccines Afluria and Afluria Quadrivalent for administration by a jet injector device the PharmaJet Stratis 05ml Needlefree Jet Injector for people 18 through 64 years of age These are the only two influenza vaccines approved for administration by jet injector People aged 18 through 64 years may receive these vaccines either by jet injector or needle A jet injector is a medical device used for vaccination that uses a highpressure narrow stream of fluid to penetrate the skin instead of a hypodermic needle More information about Flu Vaccination by Jet Injector is available What is adjuvanted flu vaccine The US Food and Drug Administration FDA licensed a seasonal influenza flu vaccine containing adjuvant for adults 65 years of age and older An adjuvant is an ingredient added to a vaccine to create a stronger immune response to vaccination FLUAD was licensed in November 2015 and will be available during the 20182019 flu season It contains the MF59 adjuvant an oilinwater emulsion of squalene oil FLUAD is the first adjuvanted seasonal flu vaccine marketed in the United States How long does a flu vaccine protect me from getting flu Multiple studies conducted over different seasons and across flu vaccine types and influenza virus subtypes have shown that the bodys immunity to influenza viruses acquired either through natural infection or vaccination declines over time The decline in antibodies is influenced by several factors including the antigen used in the vaccine the age of the person being vaccinated and the persons general health for example certain chronic health conditions may have an impact on immunity Older people and others with weakened immune systems may not generate the same amount of antibodies after vaccination further their antibody levels may drop more quickly when compared to young healthy people Getting vaccinated each year provides the best protection against flu throughout flu season Its important to get a flu vaccine every season even if you got vaccinated the season before and the viruses in the flu vaccine have not changed for the current season Can I get vaccinated and still get the flu Yes Its possible to get sick with flu even if you have been vaccinated although you wont know for sure unless you get a flu test This is possible for the following reasons You may be exposed to a flu virus shortly before getting vaccinated or during the period that it takes the body to gain protection after getting vaccinated This exposure may result in you becoming ill with flu before the vaccine begins to protect you Antibodies that provide protection develop in the body about 2 weeks after vaccination You may be exposed to a flu virus that is not included in the seasonal flu vaccine There are many different flu viruses that circulate every year A flu vaccine is made to protect against the three or four flu viruses that research suggests will be most common Unfortunately some people can become infected with a flu virus a flu vaccine is designed to protect against despite getting vaccinated Protection provided by flu vaccination can vary widely based in part on health and age factors of the person getting vaccinated In general a flu vaccine works best among healthy younger adults and older children Some older people and people with certain chronic illnesses may develop less immunity after vaccination Flu vaccination is not a perfect tool but it is the best way to protect against flu infection Top of Page Flu Vaccine Effectiveness How effective will flu vaccines be this season Influenza vaccine effectiveness VE can vary from season to season and among different age and risk groups and even by vaccine type How well the vaccine works can depend in part on the match between the vaccine viruses used to produce vaccine and circulating viruses that season Its not possible to predict in advance what flu viruses will predominate CDC monitors circulating viruses throughout the year and provides new and updated information about their similarity to flu vaccine viruses as it becomes available Information is published weekly in FluView and summarized at intervals in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report MMWR Vaccine effectiveness estimates are also provided when they become available While vaccine effectiveness can vary recent studies show vaccine reduces the risk of flu illness by about 40 to 60 among the overall population during seasons when most circulating flu viruses are like the vaccine viruses Similar reductions against hospitalization have been observed too More information about previous vaccine effectiveness is available Will this seasons flu vaccine be a good match for circulating viruses Its not possible to predict with certainty if a flu vaccine will be a good match for circulating flu viruses A flu vaccine is made to protect against the flu viruses that research and surveillance indicate will likely be most common during the season However experts must pick which flu viruses to include in a flu vaccine many months in advance in order for flu vaccines to be produced and delivered on time Also flu viruses change constantly called drift They can change from one season to the next or they can even change within the course of one flu season Another factor that can impact vaccine effectiveness especially against influenza AH3N2 viruses are changes that can occur in vaccine viruses as they are grown in eggs which is the production method for most current flu vaccines Because of these factors there is always the possibility of a less than optimal match between circulating flu viruses and the viruses in a flu vaccine Over the course of flu season CDC studies samples of circulating flu viruses to evaluate how close a match there is between viruses used to make the flu vaccine and circulating flu viruses One of the ways that helps CDC evaluate the match between flu vaccine viruses and circulating flu viruses is with a lab process called genetic and antigenic characterization Results of genetic and antigenic characterization testing are published weekly in CDCs FluView Can a flu vaccine provide protection even if the flu vaccine is not a good match Yes antibodies made in response to vaccination with one flu virus can sometimes provide protection against different but related flu viruses A less than ideal match may result in reduced vaccine effectiveness against the flu virus that is different from what is in the flu vaccine but it might still provide some protection against flu illness In addition its important to remember that a flu vaccine contains three or four flu viruses depending on the type of vaccine you receive so that even when there is a less than ideal match or lower effectiveness against one virus a flu vaccine may protect against the other flu viruses For these reasons even during seasons when there is a less than ideal match CDC continues to recommend flu vaccination for everyone 6 months and older Vaccination is particularly important for people at high risk for serious flu complications and their close contacts Top of Page If You Get Sick What happens in the body when someone has flu Influenza viruses usually infect the respiratory tract ie the airways of the nose throat and lungs As the infection progresses the bodys immune system responds to fight the virus This results in inflammation that can trigger respiratory symptoms such as cough and sore throat The immune system response can also trigger fever and cause muscle or body aches When infected persons cough sneeze or talk they can spread influenza viruses in respiratory droplets to people who are nearby People might also get flu by touching a contaminated surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth or nose Most people who become sick will recover in a few days to less than two weeks but some people may become more severely ill Following flu infection moderate complications such as secondary ear and sinus infections can occur Pneumonia is a serious flu complication that can result from either influenza virus infection alone or from coinfection of flu virus and bacteria Other possible serious complications triggered by flu can include inflammation of the heart myocarditis brain encephalitis or muscle myositis rhabdomyolysis tissues and multiorgan failure for example respiratory and kidney failure Severe complications can happen to anyone but may be more likely to happen to people who have certain chronic medical conditions or in elderly persons What should I do if I get sick with flu Most people with flu have mild illness and do not need medical care or antiviral drugs If you get sick with flu symptoms in most cases you should stay home and avoid contact with other people except to get medical care If however you have symptoms of flu and are at high risk of flu complications or are very sick or concerned about your illness contact your health care provider There are drugs your doctor may prescribe for treating flu called antivirals These drugs can make you better faster and may also prevent serious complications Antiviral drugs are prescription drugs that can be used to treat flu illness People at high risk of serious flu complications recommended for prompt antiviral treatment include children younger than 2 years of age although all children younger than 5 years are considered at higher risk for complications from influenza the highest risk is for those younger than 2 years of age adults 65 years of age and older pregnant women people with certain longterm medical conditions and residents of nursing homes and other longterm care facilities Antiviral treatment as early as possible is also recommended for people who are very sick with flu such as those with complicated progressive illness or people hospitalized because of flu Other people can be treated with antivirals at their health care professionals discretion Treating high risk people or people who are very sick with flu with antiviral drugs is very important Studies show that prompt treatment with antiviral drugs can prevent serious flu complications Prompt treatment can mean the difference between having a milder illness versus very serious illness that could result in a hospital stay Treatment with antivirals works best when begun within 48 hours of getting sick but can still be beneficial when given later in the course of illness Antiviral drugs are effective across all age and risk groups Studies show that antiviral drugs are underprescribed for people who are at high risk of complications who get flu Four FDAapproved antiviral medications are recommended for use during the 20182019 flu season oseltamivir available in generic versions and under the trade name Tamiflu zanamivir Relenza peramivir Rapivab and baloxavir marboxil Xofluza More information about antiviral drugs can be found at Treatment  Antiviral Drugs This guidance is consistent with the 20182019 flu season recommendations published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America IDSA on December 19 in Clinical Infectious Diseases The Flu What To Do If You Get Sick What is baloxavir marboxil Baloxavir marboxil trade name Xofluza is an influenza singledose antiviral drug approved October 24 2018 by the Food and Drug Administration FDA Baloxavir is approved for the treatment of acute uncomplicated flu in people 12 years and older who have had flu symptoms for less than 48 hours In clinical randomized trials baloxavir was similar to oseltamivir a currently recommended flu antiviral drug in alleviating flu symptoms More information regarding baloxaviris available Influenza Antiviral Drug Baloxavir Marboxil Top of Page Surveillance How does CDC track flu activity The Epidemiology and Prevention Branch in the Influenza Division at CDC collects compiles and analyzes information on flu activity year round in the United States and produces FluView a weekly influenza surveillance report and FluView Interactive which allows for more indepth exploration of influenza surveillance data The US influenza surveillance system is a collaborative effort between CDC and its many partners in state local and territorial health departments public health and clinical laboratories vital statistics offices healthcare providers clinics and emergency departments Information in five categories is collected from eight different data sources that allow CDC to Find out when and where influenza activity is occurring Track influenzarelated illness Determine what influenza viruses are circulating Detect changes in influenza viruses Measure the impact influenza is having on hospitalizations and deaths in the United States For more information visit Overview of Influenza Surveillance in the United States What will CDC do to monitor flu vaccine effectiveness for the 20182019 season CDC collaborates with partners each season to assess how well the seasonal flu vaccines are working During the 20182019 season CDC is planning multiple studies on the effectiveness of flu shots These studies measure vaccine effectiveness in preventing laboratoryconfirmed influenza among persons 6 months of age and older A summary of CDCs latest vaccine effectiveness estimates is available at Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness 20052018 What is CDC doing to monitor antiviral resistance in the United States during the 20182019 season Antiviral resistance means that a virus has changed in such a way that antiviral drugs are less effective or not effective at all in treating or preventing illnesses with that virus CDC will continue to collect and monitor flu viruses for changes through an established network of domestic and global surveillance systems CDC also is working with the state public health departments and the World Health Organization to collect additional information on antiviral resistance in the United States and worldwide The information collected will assist in making informed recommendations regarding use of antiviral drugs to treat influenza How does CDC estimate the burden of seasonal flu on the United States The burden of influenza on the United States can vary widely from season to season and is determined by a number of factors including the characteristics of circulating viruses the timing of the season population immunity to circulating viruses how well flu vaccines are working and how many people have gotten vaccinated While the impact of flu varies it places a substantial burden on the health of people in the United States each year CDC uses a model to estimate the numbers of influenza illnesses medical visits and hospitalizations in the United States as well as the impact of influenza vaccination on these numbers The same model is also extended to estimate flurelated deaths in the United States This methodology has been used to retroactively calculate influenza burden including deaths going back to 2010 Starting with the 20182019 flu season CDC will report cumulative inseason estimates of the burden of influenza These Preliminary InSeason Burden Estimates will be updated weekly over the course of the flu season How does CDC classify flu season severity In 2017 CDC adopted and outlined a new methodology for determining flu season severity Based on data from past flu seasons CDC researchers used key flu indicator data to develop intensity thresholds ITs to classify the severity of flu seasons Based on the intensity thresholds CDC researchers classified seasonal severity from 20032004 through the 20172018 flu seasons Overall four seasons were classified as low severity seven as moderate two as high and none as very high What is flu forecasting Influenza flu places a significant disease burden on the US population each year but the magnitude and timing varies from season to season making the annual impact difficult to predict at the beginning of each season Flu forecasting can change that by predicting in advance when the start peak and increases in flu activity will occur Unlike CDCs traditional influenza surveillance systems which measure influenza activity after it has occurred flu forecasting offers the possibility to look into the future and better plan ahead potentially reducing the impact of flu \n",
      "whats new this flu season a few things are new this season flu vaccines have been updated to better match circulating viruses the bvictoria component was changed and the influenza ah3n2 component was updated for the 20182019 season the nasal spray flu vaccine live attenuated influenza vaccine or laiv is again a recommended option for influenza vaccination of persons for whom it is otherwise appropriate the nasal spray is approved for use in nonpregnant individuals 2 to 49 years old there is a precaution against the use of laiv for people with certain underlying medical conditions all laiv will be quadrivalent fourcomponent most regulardose eggbased flu shots will be quadrivalent all recombinant vaccine will be quadrivalent no trivalent recombinant vaccine will be

before flu season begins cdc recommends that people get a flu vaccine by the end of october getting vaccinated later however can still be beneficial and vaccination should continue to be offered throughout flu season even into january or later children who need two doses of vaccine to be protected should start the vaccination process sooner because the two doses must be given at least four weeks apart can i get a flu vaccine if i am allergic to eggs the recommendations for people with egg allergies are the same as last season people who have experienced only hives after exposure to egg can get any licensed flu vaccine that is otherwise appropriate for their age and health people who have symptoms other than hives after exposure to eggs such as angioedema respiratory distress lightheadedness or recurrent emesis or who have needed epinephrine or another emergency medical intervention can also get any licensed flu vaccine that is otherwise appropriate for their age and health but the vaccine should be given in a medical setting and be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic conditions settings include hospitals

how many adults die from flu each year flu deaths in adults are not nationally notifiable in order to monitor influenza related deaths in all age groups cdc tracks pneumonia and influenza piattributed deaths through the national center for health statistics nchs mortality reporting system this system tracks the proportion of death certificates processed that list pneumonia or influenza as the underlying or contributing cause of death this system provides an overall indication of whether fluassociated deaths are elevated but does not provide an exact number of how many people died from flu as it does for the numbers of flu cases doctors visits and hospitalizations cdc also estimates deaths in the united states using mathematical modeling cdc estimates that from 20102011 to 20172018 influenzaassociated deaths in the united states ranged from a low of 12000 during 20112012 to a high of 79000 during 20172018 the model used to estimate fluassociated deaths uses a ratio of deathstohospitalizations in order to estimate the total flurelated deaths during a season for more information how cdc estimates burden as data allow cdc will begin reporting cumulative inseason estimates of the influenza mortality burden more information regarding these preliminary inseason burden estimates is available for more information overview of influenza surveillance in the united states mortality surveillance how many children die from flu each year influenzaassociated deaths in children people younger than 18 became nationally reportable in 2004 since that time the number of pediatric flu deaths reported to cdc each year has ranged from 37 20112012 season to 185 deaths 20172018 season its important to note that the actual number of flu deaths in children is thought to be higher than what is reported by states to cdc because not all flu deaths in children are detectedreported cdc also estimates the numbers of flurelated deaths using statistical models estimates of deaths in children since 2010 have ranged from 37 20112012 to about 1200 20122013 cdc believes these estimated numbers of pediatric deaths are likely a better estimate of the number of pediatric flu deaths for more information on these estimates see cdcs disease burden of influenza page why is it difficult to know exactly how many people die from flu there are several factors that make it difficult to determine accurate numbers of deaths caused by flu regardless of reporting some of the challenges in counting flu associated deaths include the following the sheer volume of deaths to be counted the lack of testing not everyone that dies with an influenzalike illness is tested for influenza and the different coding of deaths influenzaassociated deaths often are a result of complications secondary to underlying medical problems and this may be difficult to sort out for more information estimating seasonal influenzaassociated deaths in the united states top of page protective actions what should i do to protect myself from flu this season cdc recommends a yearly flu vaccine for everyone 6 months of age and older as the first and most important step in protecting against this serious disease in addition to getting a seasonal flu vaccine you can take everyday preventive actions like staying away from sick people and washing your hands to reduce the spread of germs if you are sick with flu stay home from work or school to prevent spreading flu to others in addition there are prescription medications called antiviral drugs that can be used to treat influenza illness what should i do to protect my loved ones from flu this season encourage your loved ones to get vaccinated vaccination is especially important for people at high risk for developing flu complications and their close contacts also if you have a loved one who is at high risk of flu complications and they develop flu symptoms encourage them to get a medical evaluation for possible treatment with flu antiviral drugs these drugs work best if given within 48 hours of when symptoms start cdc recommends that people who are at high risk for serious flu complications and who get flu symptoms during flu season be treated with flu antiviral drugs as quickly as possible without waiting for confirmatory testing people who are not at high risk for serious flu complications may also be treated with flu antiviral drugs especially if treatment can begin within 48 hours do some children require two doses of flu vaccine yes some children 6 months through 8 years of age will require two doses of flu vaccine for adequate protection from flu children in this age group who are getting vaccinated for the first time will need two doses of flu vaccine spaced at least 4 weeks apart children who have only received one dose in their lifetime also need two doses your childs doctor or other health care professional can tell you if your child needs two doses of flu vaccine what can i do to protect children who are too young to get vaccinated children younger than 6 months old are at high risk of serious flu complications but are too young to get a flu vaccine because of this safeguarding them from flu is especially important if you live with or care for an infant younger than 6 months old you should get a flu vaccine to help protect them from flu advice for caregivers of young children is available for more information everyone else who is around the baby also should be vaccinated also studies have shown that flu vaccination of the mother during pregnancy can protect the baby after birth from flu infection for several months in addition to getting vaccinated you and your loved ones can take everyday preventive actions like staying away from sick people and washing your hands to reduce the spread of germs if you are sick with flu stay home from work or school to prevent spreading flu to others top of page vaccine and vaccination how much flu vaccine will be available this season flu vaccine is produced by private manufacturers so supply depends on manufacturers for the 20182019 season manufacturers projected they would provide between 163 million and 168 million doses of injectable vaccine for the us market projections may change as the season progresses flu vaccine supply updates will be provided as they become available at seasonal influenza vaccine  total doses distributed are any of the available flu vaccines recommended over the others for the 20182019 flu season acip recommends annual influenza vaccination for everyone 6 months and older with any licensed ageappropriate flu vaccine iiv riv4 or laiv4 with no preference expressed for any one vaccine over another there are many vaccine options to choose from the most important thing is for all people 6 months and older to get a flu vaccine every year if you have questions about which vaccine is best for you talk to your doctor or other health care professional why is the nasal spray being recommended as an option this year when it has been shown to not be effective in past flu seasons while observational data from 201011 through 201516 flu seasons indicate that laiv was not effective among 2 through 17yearolds against h1n1pdm09 influenza viruses in the us laiv was effective against influenza b viruses and was similarly effective to inactivated influenza vaccines against h3n2 viruses some data suggest that the new h1n1 vaccine virus included in the new laiv vaccines will have improved effectiveness against circulating h1n1 viruses however no published effectiveness estimates are available yet when should i get vaccinated getting vaccinated before flu activity begins helps protect you once flu season starts in your community it takes about two weeks after vaccination for the bodys immune response to fully respond and for you to be protected so make plans to get vaccinated cdc recommends that people get a flu vaccine by the end of october however getting vaccinated later can still be beneficial cdc recommends ongoing flu vaccination as long as influenza viruses are circulating even into january or later children 6 months to 8 years old who need two doses of vaccine should get the first dose as soon after vaccine is available to allow time to get the second dose before the start of flu season the two doses should be given at least 4 weeks apart where can i get a flu vaccine flu vaccines are offered by many doctors offices clinics health departments pharmacies and college health centers as well as by many employers and even by some schools even if you dont have a regular doctor or nurse you can get a flu vaccine somewhere else like a health department pharmacy urgent care clinic and often your school college health center or work the healthmap vaccine finder helps you to locate where you can get a flu vaccine what is flu vaccination using a jet injector the us food and drug administration fda has approved two influenza vaccines afluria and afluria quadrivalent for administration by a jet injector device the pharmajet stratis 05ml needlefree jet injector for people 18 through 64 years of age these are the only two influenza vaccines approved for administration by jet injector people aged 18 through 64 years may receive these vaccines either by jet injector or needle a jet injector is a medical device used for vaccination that uses a highpressure narrow stream of fluid to penetrate the skin instead of a hypodermic needle more information about flu vaccination by jet injector is available what is adjuvanted flu vaccine the us food and drug administration fda licensed a seasonal influenza flu vaccine containing adjuvant for adults 65 years of age and older an adjuvant is an ingredient added to a vaccine to create a stronger immune response to vaccination fluad was licensed in november 2015 and will be available during the 20182019 flu season it contains the mf59 adjuvant an oilinwater emulsion of squalene oil fluad is the first adjuvanted seasonal flu vaccine marketed in the united states how long does a flu vaccine protect me from getting flu multiple studies conducted over different seasons and across flu vaccine types and influenza virus subtypes have shown that the bodys immunity to influenza viruses acquired either through natural infection or vaccination declines over time the decline in antibodies is influenced by several factors including the antigen used in the vaccine the age of the person being vaccinated and the persons general health for example certain chronic health conditions may have an impact on immunity older people and others with weakened immune systems may not generate the same amount of antibodies after vaccination further their antibody levels may drop more quickly when compared to young healthy people getting vaccinated each year provides the best protection against flu throughout flu season its important to get a flu vaccine every season even if you got vaccinated the season before and the viruses in the flu vaccine have not changed for the current season can i get vaccinated and still get the flu yes its possible to get sick with flu even if you have been vaccinated although you wont know for sure unless you get a flu test this is possible for the following reasons you may be exposed to a flu virus shortly before getting vaccinated or during the period that it takes the body to gain protection after getting vaccinated this exposure may result in you becoming ill with flu before the vaccine begins to protect you antibodies that provide protection develop in the body about 2 weeks after vaccination you may be exposed to a flu virus that is not included in the seasonal flu vaccine there are many different flu viruses that circulate every year a flu vaccine is made to protect against the three or four flu viruses that research suggests will be most common unfortunately some people can become infected with a flu virus a flu vaccine is designed to protect against despite getting vaccinated protection provided by flu vaccination can vary widely based in part on health and age factors of the person getting vaccinated in general a flu vaccine works best among healthy younger adults and older children some older people and people with certain chronic illnesses may develop less immunity after vaccination flu vaccination is not a perfect tool but it is the best way to protect against flu infection top of page flu vaccine effectiveness how effective will flu vaccines be this season influenza vaccine effectiveness ve can vary from season to season and among different age and risk groups and even by vaccine type how well the vaccine works can depend in part on the match between the vaccine viruses used to produce vaccine and circulating viruses that season its not possible to predict in advance what flu viruses will predominate cdc monitors circulating viruses throughout the year and provides new and updated information about their similarity to flu vaccine viruses as it becomes available information is published weekly in fluview and summarized at intervals in the morbidity and mortality weekly report mmwr vaccine effectiveness estimates are also provided when they become available while vaccine effectiveness can vary recent studies show vaccine reduces the risk of flu illness by about 40 to 60 among the overall population during seasons when most circulating flu viruses are like the vaccine viruses similar reductions against hospitalization have been observed too more information about previous vaccine effectiveness is available will this seasons flu vaccine be a good match for circulating viruses its not possible to predict with certainty if a flu vaccine will be a good match for circulating flu viruses a flu vaccine is made to protect against the flu viruses that research and surveillance indicate will likely be most common during the season however experts must pick which flu viruses to include in a flu vaccine many months in advance in order for flu vaccines to be produced and delivered on time also flu viruses change constantly called drift they can change from one season to the next or they can even change within the course of one flu season another factor that can impact vaccine effectiveness especially against influenza ah3n2 viruses are changes that can occur in vaccine viruses as they are grown in eggs which is the production method for most current flu vaccines because of these factors there is always the possibility of a less than optimal match between circulating flu viruses and the viruses in a flu vaccine over the course of flu season cdc studies samples of circulating flu viruses to evaluate how close a match there is between viruses used to make the flu vaccine and circulating flu viruses one of the ways that helps cdc evaluate the match between flu vaccine viruses and circulating flu viruses is with a lab process called genetic and antigenic characterization results of genetic and antigenic characterization testing are published weekly in cdcs fluview can a flu vaccine provide protection even if the flu vaccine is not a good match yes antibodies made in response to vaccination with one flu virus can sometimes provide protection against different but related flu viruses a less than ideal match may result in reduced vaccine effectiveness against the flu virus that is different from what is in the flu vaccine but it might still provide some protection against flu illness in addition its important to remember that a flu vaccine contains three or four flu viruses depending on the type of vaccine you receive so that even when there is a less than ideal match or lower effectiveness against one virus a flu vaccine may protect against the other flu viruses for these reasons even during seasons when there is a less than ideal match cdc continues to recommend flu vaccination for everyone 6 months and older vaccination is particularly important for people at high risk for serious flu complications and their close contacts top of page if you get sick what happens in the body when someone has flu influenza viruses usually infect the respiratory tract ie the airways of the nose throat and lungs as the infection progresses the bodys immune system responds to fight the virus this results in inflammation that can trigger respiratory symptoms such as cough and sore throat the immune system response can also trigger fever and cause muscle or body aches when infected persons cough sneeze or talk they can spread influenza viruses in respiratory droplets to people who are nearby people might also get flu by touching a contaminated surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth or nose most people who become sick will recover in a few days to less than two weeks but some people may become more severely ill following flu infection moderate complications such as secondary ear and sinus infections can occur pneumonia is a serious flu complication that can result from either influenza virus infection alone or from coinfection of flu virus and bacteria other possible serious complications triggered by flu can include inflammation of the heart myocarditis brain encephalitis or muscle myositis rhabdomyolysis tissues and multiorgan failure for example respiratory and kidney failure severe complications can happen to anyone but may be more likely to happen to people who have certain chronic medical conditions or in elderly persons what should i do if i get sick with flu most people with flu have mild illness and do not need medical care or antiviral drugs if you get sick with flu symptoms in most cases you should stay home and avoid contact with other people except to get medical care if however you have symptoms of flu and are at high risk of flu complications or are very sick or concerned about your illness contact your health care provider there are drugs your doctor may prescribe for treating flu called antivirals these drugs can make you better faster and may also prevent serious complications antiviral drugs are prescription drugs that can be used to treat flu illness people at high risk of serious flu complications recommended for prompt antiviral treatment include children younger than 2 years of age although all children younger than 5 years are considered at higher risk for complications from influenza the highest risk is for those younger than 2 years of age adults 65 years of age and older pregnant women people with certain longterm medical conditions and residents of nursing homes and other longterm care facilities antiviral treatment as early as possible is also recommended for people who are very sick with flu such as those with complicated progressive illness or people hospitalized because of flu other people can be treated with antivirals at their health care professionals discretion treating high risk people or people who are very sick with flu with antiviral drugs is very important studies show that prompt treatment with antiviral drugs can prevent serious flu complications prompt treatment can mean the difference between having a milder illness versus very serious illness that could result in a hospital stay treatment with antivirals works best when begun within 48 hours of getting sick but can still be beneficial when given later in the course of illness antiviral drugs are effective across all age and risk groups studies show that antiviral drugs are underprescribed for people who are at high risk of complications who get flu four fdaapproved antiviral medications are recommended for use during the 20182019 flu season oseltamivir available in generic versions and under the trade name tamiflu zanamivir relenza peramivir rapivab and baloxavir marboxil xofluza more information about antiviral drugs can be found at treatment  antiviral drugs this guidance is consistent with the 20182019 flu season recommendations published by the infectious diseases society of america idsa on december 19 in clinical infectious diseases the flu what to do if you get sick what is baloxavir marboxil baloxavir marboxil trade name xofluza is an influenza singledose antiviral drug approved october 24 2018 by the food and drug administration fda baloxavir is approved for the treatment of acute uncomplicated flu in people 12 years and older who have had flu symptoms for less than 48 hours in clinical randomized trials baloxavir was similar to oseltamivir a currently recommended flu antiviral drug in alleviating flu symptoms more information regarding baloxaviris available influenza antiviral drug baloxavir marboxil top of page surveillance how does cdc track flu activity the epidemiology and prevention branch in the influenza division at cdc collects compiles and analyzes information on flu activity year round in the united states and produces fluview a weekly influenza surveillance report and fluview interactive which allows for more indepth exploration of influenza surveillance data the us influenza surveillance system is a collaborative effort between cdc and its many partners in state local and territorial health departments public health and clinical laboratories vital statistics offices healthcare providers clinics and emergency departments information in five categories is collected from eight different data sources that allow cdc to find out when and where influenza activity is occurring track influenzarelated illness determine what influenza viruses are circulating detect changes in influenza viruses measure the impact influenza is having on hospitalizations and deaths in the united states for more information visit overview of influenza surveillance in the united states what will cdc do to monitor flu vaccine effectiveness for the 20182019 season cdc collaborates with partners each season to assess how well the seasonal flu vaccines are working during the 20182019 season cdc is planning multiple studies on the effectiveness of flu shots these studies measure vaccine effectiveness in preventing laboratoryconfirmed influenza among persons 6 months of age and older a summary of cdcs latest vaccine effectiveness estimates is available at seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness 20052018 what is cdc doing to monitor antiviral resistance in the united states during the 20182019 season antiviral resistance means that a virus has changed in such a way that antiviral drugs are less effective or not effective at all in treating or preventing illnesses with that virus cdc will continue to collect and monitor flu viruses for changes through an established network of domestic and global surveillance systems cdc also is working with the state public health departments and the world health organization to collect additional information on antiviral resistance in the united states and worldwide the information collected will assist in making informed recommendations regarding use of antiviral drugs to treat influenza how does cdc estimate the burden of seasonal flu on the united states the burden of influenza on the united states can vary widely from season to season and is determined by a number of factors including the characteristics of circulating viruses the timing of the season population immunity to circulating viruses how well flu vaccines are working and how many people have gotten vaccinated while the impact of flu varies it places a substantial burden on the health of people in the united states each year cdc uses a model to estimate the numbers of influenza illnesses medical visits and hospitalizations in the united states as well as the impact of influenza vaccination on these numbers the same model is also extended to estimate flurelated deaths in the united states this methodology has been used to retroactively calculate influenza burden including deaths going back to 2010 starting with the 20182019 flu season cdc will report cumulative inseason estimates of the burden of influenza these preliminary inseason burden estimates will be updated weekly over the course of the flu season how does cdc classify flu season severity in 2017 cdc adopted and outlined a new methodology for determining flu season severity based on data from past flu seasons cdc researchers used key flu indicator data to develop intensity thresholds its to classify the severity of flu seasons based on the intensity thresholds cdc researchers classified seasonal severity from 20032004 through the 20172018 flu seasons overall four seasons were classified as low severity seven as moderate two as high and none as very high what is flu forecasting influenza flu places a significant disease burden on the us population each year but the magnitude and timing varies from season to season making the annual impact difficult to predict at the beginning of each season flu forecasting can change that by predicting in advance when the start peak and increases in flu activity will occur unlike cdcs traditional influenza surveillance systems which measure influenza activity after it has occurred flu forecasting offers the possibility to look into the future and better plan ahead potentially reducing the impact of flu \n"

      "whats new this flu season a few things are new this season flu vaccines have been updated to better match circulating viruses the bvictoria component was changed and the influenza ah3n2 component was updated for the 20182019 season the nasal spray flu vaccine live attenuated influenza vaccine or laiv is again a recommended option for influenza vaccination of persons for whom it is otherwise appropriate the nasal spray is approved for use in nonpregnant individuals 2 to 49 years old there is a precaution against the use of laiv for people with certain underlying medical conditions all laiv will be quadrivalent fourcomponent most regulardose eggbased flu shots will be quadrivalent all recombinant vaccine will be quadrivalent no trivalent recombinant vaccine will be available this season cellgrown flu vaccine will be quadrivalent for this vaccine the influenza ah3n2 and both influenza b reference viruses will be cellderived and the influenza ah1n1 will be eggderived all these reference viruses will be grown in cells to produce the components of flucelvax no intradermal flu vaccine will be available the age recommendation for fluarix quadrivalent was changed from 3 years and older to 6 months and older after the annual recommendations were published last season to be consistent with food and drug administration fdaapproved labeling the age recommendation for afluria quadrivalent was changed from 18 years and older to 5 years and older after the annual recommendations were published last season to be consistent with food and drug administration fdaapproved labeling baloxavir marboxil trade name xofluza is a new influenza singledose antiviral drug approved october 24 2018 by the food and drug administration fda baloxavir is approved for the treatment of acute uncomplicated flu in people 12 years and older who have had flu symptoms for less than 48 hours more information is available influenza antiviral drug baloxavir marboxil cdc is reporting inseason estimates of the cumulative number of flu illnesses medical visits and hospitalizations in the us these preliminary inseason burden estimates will be updated weekly over the course of the flu season what flu vaccines are recommended this season for the 20182019 flu season providers may choose to administer any licensed ageappropriate flu vaccine iiv riv4 or laiv4 options this season include standard dose flu shots these are given into the muscle they are usually given with a needle but two afluria and afluria quadrivalent can be given to some people those 18 to 64 years old with a jet injector highdose shots for older people shots made with adjuvant for older people shots made with virus grown in cell culture shots made using a vaccine production technology recombinant vaccine that does not require the use of flu virus live attenuated influenza vaccine laiv  or the nasal spray vaccine  is also an option for use during the 20182019 season for persons whom it is otherwise appropriate there is a table showing all flu vaccines that are fdaapproved for use in the united states during the 20182019 season what viruses will the 20182019 flu vaccines protect against there are many different flu viruses and they are constantly changing the composition of us flu vaccines is reviewed annually and updated as needed to match circulating flu viruses flu vaccines protect against the three or four viruses depending on vaccine that research suggests will be most common for 20182019 trivalent threecomponent vaccines are recommended to contain amichigan452015 h1n1pdm09like virus asingaporeinfimh1600192016 ah3n2like virus updated bcolorado062017like victoria lineage virus updated quadrivalent fourcomponent vaccines which protect against a second lineage of b viruses are recommended to contain the three recommended viruses above plus bphuket30732013like yamagata lineage virus when should i get vaccinated you should get a flu vaccine before flu begins spreading in your community it takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies that protect against flu to develop in the body so make plans to get vaccinated early in fall before flu season begins cdc recommends that people get a flu vaccine by the end of october getting vaccinated later however can still be beneficial and vaccination should continue to be offered throughout flu season even into january or later children who need two doses of vaccine to be protected should start the vaccination process sooner because the two doses must be given at least four weeks apart can i get a flu vaccine if i am allergic to eggs the recommendations for people with egg allergies are the same as last season people who have experienced only hives after exposure to egg can get any licensed flu vaccine that is otherwise appropriate for their age and health people who have symptoms other than hives after exposure to eggs such as angioedema respiratory distress lightheadedness or recurrent emesis or who have needed epinephrine or another emergency medical intervention can also get any licensed flu vaccine that is otherwise appropriate for their age and health but the vaccine should be given in a medical setting and be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic conditions settings include hospitals clinics health departments and physician offices people with egg allergies no longer have to wait 30 minutes after receiving their vaccine implications of cellbased vaccines why is it significant that cellgrown vaccine reference viruses are used to produce some components of one type of flu vaccine cellgrown reference viruses do not have the changes that are present in egggrown reference viruses so they should be more similar to circulating wildtype viruses vaccine effectiveness depends in part on the match between the vaccine virus and circulating flu viruses is flu vaccine made using a cellgrown reference virus and cellbased technology more effective than vaccine made using an egggrown reference virus and eggbased technology while the use of cellgrown reference viruses and cellbased technology may offer the potential for better protection over traditional eggbased flu vaccines because they result in vaccine viruses that are more similar to flu viruses in circulation there are no data yet to support this there is no preferential recommendation for one injectable flu vaccine over another top of page flu activity what sort of flu season is expected this year it is not possible to predict what this flu season will be like while flu spreads every year the timing severity and length of the season varies from one season to another will new flu viruses circulate this season flu viruses are constantly changing so its not unusual for new flu viruses to appear each year more information about how flu viruses change is available will the united states have a flu epidemic the united states experiences annual epidemics of seasonal flu this time of year is called flu season in the united states flu viruses are most common during the fall and winter months influenza activity often begins to increase in october and november most of the time flu activity peaks between december and february and it can last as late as may cdc monitors certain key flu indicators for example outpatient visits of influenzalike illness ili the results of laboratory testing and reports of flu hospitalizations and deaths when these indicators rise and remain elevated for a number of consecutive weeks flu season is said to have begun usually ili increases first followed by an increase in fluassociated hospitalizations which is then followed by increases in fluassociated deaths for the most current influenza surveillance information weekly us influenza surveillance report when will flu activity begin and when will it peak the timing of flu is unpredictable and can vary in different parts of the country and from season to season seasonal flu viruses can be detected yearround however seasonal flu activity often begins as early as october and november and can continue to occur as late as may flu activity most commonly peaks in the united states between december and february how many people get sick with flu every year cdc conducts surveillance for people who see their health care provider for flulike illness through the outpatient influenzalike illness surveillance network ilinet a network of thousands of health care providers who report the proportion of patients seeking care for flulike illness weekly to cdc this system allows cdc to track levels of medically attended flulike illness over the course of the flu season cdc does not know exactly how many people get sick with seasonal flu each year there are several reasons for this including that ilinet does not include every health care provider and monitors flulike illness not laboratoryconfirmed influenza cases also flu illness is not a reportable disease and not everyone who gets sick with flu seeks medical care or gets tested cdc uses mathematical modeling in combination with data from traditional flu surveillance systems to estimate the numbers of flu illnesses in the united states cdc estimates that flu has resulted in between 93 million and 49 million illnesses each year in the united states since 2010 more information on these estimates is available on cdcs disease burden of influenza page during the 20182019 flu season cdc began reporting cumulative inseason estimates of the disease burden of influenza including estimates of the total number of flu illnesses in the united states more information regarding these preliminary inseason burden estimates is available for more information on cdc surveillance systems see cdcs overview of influenza surveillance in the united states how many people are hospitalized from flu every year cdc conducts surveillance for flurelated hospitalizations through the influenza hospitalization surveillance network flusurvnet a collaboration between cdc the emerging infections program and additional influenza hospitalization surveillance project ihsp states in 13 geographically distributed areas in the united states the network includes hospitals that serve roughly 9 percent of the us population the data collected through flusurvnet allows cdc to calculate an overall hospitalization rate as well as by age group but this system does not provide the total number of flu hospitalizations that actually occur in the united states reported flusurvnet hospitalization rates are adjusted to correct for underdetection which is calculated from the percent of persons hospitalized with respiratory illness who were tested for influenza and the average sensitivity of influenza tests used in the participating flusurvnet surveillance hospitals cdc uses these methods to estimate the true burden of flu hospitalizations in the united states since 2010 cdc estimates that flu has resulted in between 140000 and 960000 hospitalizations each year for more information on these estimates see cdcs disease burden of influenza page during the 20182019 flu season cdc began reporting cumulative inseason estimates of disease burden of influenza including estimates of the total number of people hospitalized in the united states from flu

deaths through the national center for health statistics nchs mortality reporting system this system tracks the proportion of death certificates processed that list pneumonia or influenza as the underlying or contributing cause of death this system provides an overall indication of whether fluassociated deaths are elevated but does not provide an exact number of how many people died from flu as it does for the numbers of flu cases doctors visits and hospitalizations cdc also estimates deaths in the united states using mathematical modeling cdc estimates that from 20102011 to 20172018 influenzaassociated deaths in the united states ranged from a low of 12000 during 20112012 to a high of 79000 during 20172018 the model used to estimate fluassociated deaths uses a ratio of deathstohospitalizations in order to estimate the total flurelated deaths during a season for more information how cdc estimates burden as data allow cdc will begin reporting cumulative inseason estimates of the influenza mortality burden more information regarding these preliminary inseason burden estimates is available for more information overview of influenza surveillance in the united

pediatric flu deaths reported to cdc each year has ranged from 37 20112012 season to 185 deaths 20172018 season its important to note that the actual number of flu deaths in children is thought to be higher than what is reported by states to cdc because not all flu deaths in children are detectedreported cdc also estimates the numbers of flurelated deaths using statistical models estimates of deaths in children since 2010 have ranged from 37 20112012 to about 1200 20122013 cdc believes these estimated numbers of pediatric deaths are likely a better estimate of the number of pediatric flu

against this serious disease in addition to getting a seasonal flu vaccine you can take everyday preventive actions like staying away from sick people and washing your hands to reduce the spread of germs if you are sick with flu stay home from work or school to prevent spreading flu to others in addition there are prescription medications called antiviral drugs that can be used to treat influenza illness what should i do to protect my loved ones from flu this season encourage your loved ones to get vaccinated vaccination is especially important for people at high risk for developing flu complications and their close contacts also if you have a loved one who is at high risk of flu complications and they develop flu symptoms encourage them to get a medical evaluation for possible treatment with flu antiviral drugs these drugs work best if given within 48 hours of when symptoms start cdc recommends that people who are at high risk for serious flu complications and who get flu symptoms during flu season be treated with flu antiviral drugs as quickly as possible without waiting for confirmatory testing people who are not at high risk for serious flu complications may also be treated with flu antiviral drugs especially if treatment can begin within 48 hours do some children require two doses of flu vaccine yes some children 6 months through 8 years of age will require two doses of flu vaccine for adequate protection from flu children in this age group who are getting vaccinated for the first time will need two doses of flu vaccine spaced at least 4 weeks apart children who have only received one dose in their lifetime also need two doses your childs doctor or other health care professional can tell you if your child needs two doses of flu vaccine what can i do to protect children who are too young to get vaccinated children younger than 6 months old are at high risk of serious flu complications but are too young to get a flu vaccine because of this safeguarding them from flu is especially important if you live with or care for an infant younger than 6 months old you should get a flu vaccine to help protect them from flu advice for caregivers of young children is available for more information everyone else who is around the baby also should be vaccinated also studies have shown that flu vaccination of the mother during pregnancy can protect the baby after birth from flu infection for several months in addition to getting vaccinated you and your loved ones can take everyday preventive actions like staying away from sick people and washing your hands to reduce the spread of germs if you are sick with flu stay home from work or school to prevent spreading flu to others top of page vaccine and vaccination how much flu vaccine will be available this season flu vaccine is produced by private manufacturers so supply depends on manufacturers for the 20182019 season manufacturers projected they would provide between 163 million and 168 million doses of injectable vaccine for the us market projections may change as the season progresses flu vaccine supply updates will be provided as they become available at seasonal influenza vaccine  total doses distributed are any of the available flu vaccines recommended over the others for the 20182019 flu season acip recommends annual influenza vaccination for everyone 6 months and older with any licensed ageappropriate flu vaccine iiv riv4 or laiv4 with no preference expressed for any one vaccine over another there are many vaccine options to choose from the most important thing is for all people 6 months and older to get a flu vaccine every year if you have questions about which vaccine is best for you talk to your doctor or other health care professional why is the nasal spray being recommended as an option this year when it has been shown to not be effective in past flu seasons while observational data from 201011 through 201516 flu seasons indicate that laiv was not effective among 2 through 17yearolds against h1n1pdm09 influenza viruses in the us laiv was effective against influenza b viruses and was similarly effective to inactivated influenza vaccines against h3n2 viruses some data suggest that the new h1n1 vaccine virus included in the new laiv vaccines will have improved effectiveness against circulating h1n1 viruses however no published effectiveness estimates are available yet when should i get vaccinated getting vaccinated before flu activity begins helps protect you once flu season starts in your community it takes about two weeks after vaccination for the bodys immune response to fully respond and for you to be protected so make plans to get vaccinated cdc recommends that people get a flu vaccine by the end of october however getting vaccinated later can still be beneficial cdc recommends ongoing flu vaccination as long as influenza viruses are circulating even into january or later children 6 months to 8 years old who need two doses of vaccine should get the first dose as soon after vaccine is available to allow time to get the second dose before the start of flu season the two doses should be given at least 4 weeks apart where can i get a flu vaccine flu vaccines are offered by many doctors offices clinics health departments pharmacies and college health centers as well as by many employers and even by some schools even if you dont have a regular doctor or nurse you can get a flu vaccine somewhere else like a health department pharmacy urgent care clinic and often your school college health center or work the healthmap vaccine finder helps you to locate where you can get a flu vaccine what is flu vaccination using a jet injector the us food and drug administration fda has approved two influenza vaccines afluria and afluria quadrivalent for administration by a jet injector device the pharmajet stratis 05ml needlefree jet injector for people 18 through 64 years of age these are the only two influenza vaccines approved for administration by jet injector people aged 18 through 64 years may receive these vaccines either by jet injector or needle a jet injector is a medical device used for vaccination that uses a highpressure narrow stream of fluid to penetrate the skin instead of a hypodermic needle more information about flu vaccination by jet injector is available what is adjuvanted flu vaccine the us food and drug administration fda licensed a seasonal influenza flu vaccine containing adjuvant for adults 65 years of age and older an adjuvant is an ingredient added to a vaccine to create a stronger immune response to vaccination fluad was licensed in november 2015 and will be available during the 20182019 flu season it contains the mf59 adjuvant an oilinwater emulsion of squalene oil fluad is the first adjuvanted seasonal flu vaccine marketed in the united states how long does a flu vaccine protect me from getting flu multiple studies conducted over different seasons and across flu vaccine types and influenza virus subtypes have shown that the bodys immunity to influenza viruses acquired either through natural infection or vaccination declines over time the decline in antibodies is influenced by several factors including the antigen used in the vaccine the age of the person being vaccinated and the persons general health for example certain chronic health conditions may have an impact on immunity older people and others with weakened immune systems may not generate the same amount of antibodies after vaccination further their antibody levels may drop more quickly when compared to young healthy people getting vaccinated each year provides the best protection against flu throughout flu season its important to get a flu vaccine every season even if you got vaccinated the season before and the viruses in the flu vaccine have not changed for the current season can i get vaccinated and still get the flu yes its possible to get sick with flu even if you have been vaccinated although you wont know for sure unless you get a flu test this is possible for the following reasons you may be exposed to a flu virus shortly before getting vaccinated or during the period that it takes the body to gain protection after getting vaccinated this exposure may result in you becoming ill with flu before the vaccine begins to protect you antibodies that provide protection develop in the body about 2 weeks after vaccination you may be exposed to a flu virus that is not included in the seasonal flu vaccine there are many different flu viruses that circulate every year a flu vaccine is made to protect against the three or four flu viruses that research suggests will be most common unfortunately some people can become infected with a flu virus a flu vaccine is designed to protect against despite getting vaccinated protection provided by flu vaccination can vary widely based in part on health and age factors of the person getting vaccinated in general a flu vaccine works best among healthy younger adults and older children some older people and people with certain chronic illnesses may develop less immunity after vaccination flu vaccination is not a perfect tool but it is the best way to protect against flu infection top of page flu vaccine effectiveness how effective will flu vaccines be this season influenza vaccine effectiveness ve can vary from season to season and among different age and risk groups and even by vaccine type how well the vaccine works can depend in part on the match between the vaccine viruses used to produce vaccine and circulating viruses that season its not possible to predict in advance what flu viruses will predominate cdc monitors circulating viruses throughout the year and provides new and updated information about their similarity to flu vaccine viruses as it becomes available information is published weekly in fluview and summarized at intervals in the morbidity and mortality weekly report mmwr vaccine effectiveness estimates are also provided when they become available while vaccine effectiveness can vary recent studies show vaccine reduces the risk of flu illness by about 40 to 60 among the overall population during seasons when most circulating flu viruses are like the vaccine viruses similar reductions against hospitalization have been observed too more information about previous vaccine effectiveness is available will this seasons flu vaccine be a good match for circulating viruses its not possible to predict with certainty if a flu vaccine will be a good match for circulating flu viruses a flu vaccine is made to protect against the flu viruses that research and surveillance indicate will likely be most common during the season however experts must pick which flu viruses to include in a flu vaccine many months in advance in order for flu vaccines to be produced and delivered on time also flu viruses change constantly called drift they can change from one season to the next or they can even change within the course of one flu season another factor that can impact vaccine effectiveness especially against influenza ah3n2 viruses are changes that can occur in vaccine viruses as they are grown in eggs which is the production method for most current flu vaccines because of these factors there is always the possibility of a less than optimal match between circulating flu viruses and the viruses in a flu vaccine over the course of flu season cdc studies samples of circulating flu viruses to evaluate how close a match there is between viruses used to make the flu vaccine and circulating flu viruses one of the ways that helps cdc evaluate the match between flu vaccine viruses and circulating flu viruses is with a lab process called genetic and antigenic characterization results of genetic and antigenic characterization testing are published weekly in cdcs fluview can a flu vaccine provide protection even if the flu vaccine is not a good match yes antibodies made in response to vaccination with one flu virus can sometimes provide protection against different but related flu viruses a less than ideal match may result in reduced vaccine effectiveness against the flu virus that is different from what is in the flu vaccine but it might still provide some protection against flu illness in addition its important to remember that a flu vaccine contains three or four flu viruses depending on the type of vaccine you receive so that even when there is a less than ideal match or lower effectiveness against one virus a flu vaccine may protect against the other flu viruses for these reasons even during seasons when there is a less than ideal match cdc continues to recommend flu vaccination for everyone 6 months and older vaccination is particularly important for people at high risk for serious flu complications and their close contacts top of page if you get sick what happens in the body when someone has flu influenza viruses usually infect the respiratory tract ie the airways of the nose throat and lungs as the infection progresses the bodys immune system responds to fight the virus this results in inflammation that can trigger respiratory symptoms such as cough and sore throat the immune system response can also trigger fever and cause muscle or body aches when infected persons cough sneeze or talk they can spread influenza viruses in respiratory droplets to people who are nearby people might also get flu by touching a contaminated surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth or nose most people who become sick will recover in a few days to less than two weeks but some people may become more severely ill following flu infection moderate complications such as secondary ear and sinus infections can occur pneumonia is a serious flu complication that can result from either influenza virus infection alone or from coinfection of flu virus and bacteria other possible serious complications triggered by flu can include inflammation of the heart myocarditis brain encephalitis or muscle myositis rhabdomyolysis tissues and multiorgan failure for example respiratory and kidney failure severe complications can happen to anyone but may be more likely to happen to people who have certain chronic medical conditions or in elderly persons what should i do if i get sick with flu most people with flu have mild illness and do not need medical care or antiviral drugs if you get sick with flu symptoms in most cases you should stay home and avoid contact with other people except to get medical care if however you have symptoms of flu and are at high risk of flu complications or are very sick or concerned about your illness contact your health care provider there are drugs your doctor may prescribe for treating flu called antivirals these drugs can make you better faster and may also prevent serious complications antiviral drugs are prescription drugs that can be used to treat flu illness people at high risk of serious flu complications recommended for prompt antiviral treatment include children younger than 2 years of age although all children younger than 5 years are considered at higher risk for complications from influenza the highest risk is for those younger than 2 years of age adults 65 years of age and older pregnant women people with certain longterm medical conditions and residents of nursing homes and other longterm care facilities antiviral treatment as early as possible is also recommended for people who are very sick with flu such as those with complicated progressive illness or people hospitalized because of flu other people can be treated with antivirals at their health care professionals discretion treating high risk people or people who are very sick with flu with antiviral drugs is very important studies show that prompt treatment with antiviral drugs can prevent serious flu complications prompt treatment can mean the difference between having a milder illness versus very serious illness that could result in a hospital stay treatment with antivirals works best when begun within 48 hours of getting sick but can still be beneficial when given later in the course of illness antiviral drugs are effective across all age and risk groups studies show that antiviral drugs are underprescribed for people who are at high risk of complications who get flu four fdaapproved antiviral medications are recommended for use during the 20182019 flu season oseltamivir available in generic versions and under the trade name tamiflu zanamivir relenza peramivir rapivab and baloxavir marboxil xofluza more information about antiviral drugs can be found at treatment  antiviral drugs this guidance is consistent with the 20182019 flu

and prevention branch in the influenza division at cdc collects compiles and analyzes information on flu activity year round in the united states and produces fluview a weekly influenza surveillance report and fluview interactive which allows for more indepth exploration of influenza surveillance data the us influenza surveillance system is a collaborative effort between cdc and its many partners in state local and territorial health departments public health and clinical laboratories vital statistics offices healthcare providers clinics and emergency departments information in five categories is collected from eight different data sources that allow cdc to find out when and where influenza activity is occurring track influenzarelated illness determine what influenza viruses are circulating detect changes in influenza viruses measure the impact influenza is having on hospitalizations and deaths in the united states for more information visit overview of influenza surveillance in the united states what will cdc do to monitor flu vaccine effectiveness for the 20182019 season cdc collaborates with partners each season to assess how well the seasonal flu vaccines are working during the 20182019 season cdc is planning multiple studies on the effectiveness of flu shots these studies measure vaccine effectiveness in preventing laboratoryconfirmed influenza among persons 6 months of age and older a summary of cdcs latest vaccine effectiveness estimates is available at seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness 20052018 what is cdc doing to monitor antiviral resistance in the united states during the 20182019 season antiviral resistance means that a virus has changed in such a way that antiviral drugs are less effective or not effective at all in treating or preventing illnesses with that virus cdc will continue to collect and monitor flu viruses for changes through an established network of domestic and global surveillance systems cdc also is working with the state public health departments and the world health organization to collect additional information on antiviral resistance in the united states and worldwide the information collected will assist in making informed recommendations regarding use of antiviral drugs to treat influenza how does cdc estimate the burden of seasonal flu on the united states the burden of influenza on the united states can vary widely from season to season and is determined by a number of factors including the characteristics of circulating viruses the timing of the season population immunity to circulating viruses how well flu vaccines are working and how many people have gotten vaccinated while the impact of flu varies it places a substantial burden on the health of people in the united states each year cdc uses a model to estimate the numbers of influenza illnesses medical visits and hospitalizations in the united states as well as the impact of influenza vaccination on these numbers the same model is also extended to estimate flurelated deaths in the united states this methodology has been used to retroactively calculate influenza burden including deaths going back to 2010 starting with the 20182019 flu season cdc will report cumulative inseason estimates of the burden of influenza these preliminary inseason burden estimates will be updated weekly over the course of the flu season how does cdc classify flu season severity in 2017 cdc adopted and outlined a new methodology for determining flu season severity based on data from past flu seasons cdc researchers used key flu indicator data to develop intensity thresholds its to classify the severity of flu seasons based on the intensity thresholds cdc researchers classified seasonal severity from 20032004 through the 20172018 flu seasons overall four seasons were classified as low severity seven as moderate two as high and none as very high what is flu forecasting influenza flu places a significant disease burden on the us population each year but the magnitude and timing varies from season to season making the annual impact difficult to predict at the beginning of each season flu forecasting can change that by predicting in advance when the start peak and increases in flu activity will occur unlike cdcs traditional influenza surveillance systems which measure influenza activity after it has occurred flu forecasting offers the possibility to look into the future and better plan ahead potentially reducing the impact of flu \n",
      "whats new this flu season a few things are new this season flu vaccines have been updated to better match circulating viruses the bvictoria component was changed and the influenza ah3n2 component was updated for the 20182019 season the nasal spray flu vaccine live attenuated influenza vaccine or laiv is again a recommended option for influenza vaccination of persons for whom it is otherwise appropriate the nasal spray is approved for use in nonpregnant individuals 2 to 49 years old there is a precaution against the use of laiv for people with certain underlying medical conditions all laiv will be quadrivalent fourcomponent most regulardose eggbased flu shots will be quadrivalent all recombinant vaccine will be quadrivalent no trivalent recombinant vaccine will be available this season cellgrown flu vaccine will be quadrivalent for this vaccine the influenza ah3n2 and both influenza b reference viruses will be cellderived and the influenza ah1n1 will be eggderived all these reference viruses will be grown in cells to produce the components of flucelvax no intradermal flu vaccine will be available the age recommendation for fluarix quadrivalent was changed from 3 years and older to 6 months and older after the annual recommendations were published last season to be consistent with food and drug administration fdaapproved labeling the age recommendation for afluria quadrivalent was changed from 18 years and older to 5 years and older after the annual recommendations were published last season to be consistent with food and drug administration fdaapproved labeling baloxavir marboxil trade name xofluza is a new influenza singledose antiviral drug approved october 24 2018 by the food and drug administration fda baloxavir is approved for the treatment of acute uncomplicated flu in people 12 years and older who have had flu symptoms for less than 48 hours more information is available influenza antiviral drug baloxavir marboxil cdc is reporting inseason estimates of the cumulative number of flu illnesses medical visits and hospitalizations in the us these preliminary inseason burden estimates will be updated weekly over the course of the flu season what flu vaccines are recommended this season for the 20182019 flu season providers may choose to administer any licensed ageappropriate flu vaccine iiv riv4 or laiv4 options this season include standard dose flu shots these are given into the muscle they are usually given with a needle but two afluria and afluria quadrivalent can be given to some people those 18 to 64 years old with a jet injector highdose shots for older people shots made with adjuvant for older people shots made with virus grown in cell culture shots made using a vaccine production technology recombinant vaccine that does not require the use of flu virus live attenuated influenza vaccine laiv  or the nasal spray vaccine  is also an option for use during the 20182019 season for persons whom it is otherwise appropriate there is a table showing all flu vaccines that are fdaapproved for use in the united states during the 20182019 season what viruses will the 20182019 flu vaccines protect against there are many different flu viruses and they are constantly changing the composition of us flu vaccines is reviewed annually and updated as needed to match circulating flu viruses flu vaccines protect against the three or four viruses depending on vaccine that research suggests will be most common for 20182019 trivalent threecomponent vaccines are recommended to contain amichigan452015 h1n1pdm09like virus asingaporeinfimh1600192016 ah3n2like virus updated bcolorado062017like victoria lineage virus updated quadrivalent fourcomponent vaccines which protect against a second lineage of b viruses are recommended to contain the three recommended viruses above plus bphuket30732013like yamagata lineage virus when should i get vaccinated you should get a flu vaccine before flu begins spreading in your community it takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies that protect against flu to develop in the body so make plans to get vaccinated early in fall before flu season begins cdc recommends that people get a flu vaccine by the end of october getting vaccinated later however can still be beneficial and vaccination should continue to be offered throughout flu season even into january or later children who need two doses of vaccine to be protected should start the vaccination process sooner because the two doses must be given at least four weeks apart can i get a flu vaccine if i am allergic to eggs the recommendations for people with egg allergies are the same as last season people who have experienced only hives after exposure to egg can get any licensed flu vaccine that is otherwise appropriate for their age and health people who have symptoms other than hives after exposure to eggs such as angioedema respiratory distress lightheadedness or recurrent emesis or who have needed epinephrine or another emergency medical intervention can also get any licensed flu vaccine that is otherwise appropriate for their age and health but the vaccine should be given in a medical setting and be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic conditions settings include hospitals clinics health departments and physician offices people with egg allergies no longer have to wait 30 minutes after receiving their vaccine implications of cellbased vaccines why is it significant that cellgrown vaccine reference viruses are used to produce some components of one type of flu vaccine cellgrown reference viruses do not have the changes that are present in egggrown reference viruses so they should be more similar to circulating wildtype viruses vaccine effectiveness depends in part on the match between the vaccine virus and circulating flu viruses is flu vaccine made using a cellgrown reference virus and cellbased technology more effective than vaccine made using an egggrown reference virus and eggbased technology while the use of cellgrown reference viruses and cellbased technology may offer the potential for better protection over traditional eggbased flu vaccines because they result in vaccine viruses that are more similar to flu viruses in circulation there are no data yet to support this there is no preferential recommendation for one injectable flu vaccine over another top of page flu activity what sort of flu season is expected this year it is not possible to predict what this flu season will be like while flu spreads every year the timing severity and length of the season varies from one season to another will new flu viruses circulate this season flu viruses are constantly changing so its not unusual for new flu viruses to appear each year more information about how flu viruses change is available will the united states have a flu epidemic the united states experiences annual epidemics of seasonal flu this time of year is called flu season in the united states flu viruses are most common during the fall and winter months influenza activity often begins to increase in october and november most of the time flu activity peaks between december and february and it can last as late as may cdc monitors certain key flu indicators for example outpatient visits of influenzalike illness ili the results of laboratory testing and reports of flu hospitalizations and deaths when these indicators rise and remain elevated for a number of consecutive weeks flu season is said to have begun usually ili increases first followed by an increase in fluassociated hospitalizations which is then followed by increases in fluassociated deaths for the most current influenza surveillance information weekly us influenza surveillance report when will flu activity begin and when will it peak the timing of flu is unpredictable and can vary in different parts of the country and from season to season seasonal flu viruses can be detected yearround however seasonal flu activity often begins as early as october and november and can continue to occur as late as may flu activity most commonly peaks in the united states between december and february how many people get sick with flu every year cdc conducts surveillance for people who see their health care provider for flulike illness through the outpatient influenzalike illness surveillance network ilinet a network of thousands of health care providers who report the proportion of patients seeking care for flulike illness weekly to cdc this system allows cdc to track levels of medically attended flulike illness over the course of the flu season cdc does not know exactly how many people get sick with seasonal flu each year there are several reasons for this including that ilinet does not include every health care provider and monitors flulike illness not laboratoryconfirmed influenza cases also flu illness is not a reportable disease and not everyone who gets sick with flu seeks medical care or gets tested cdc uses mathematical modeling in combination with data from traditional flu surveillance systems to estimate the numbers of flu illnesses in the united states cdc estimates that flu has resulted in between 93 million and 49 million illnesses each year in the united states since 2010 more information on these estimates is available on cdcs disease burden of influenza page during the 20182019 flu season cdc began reporting cumulative inseason estimates of the disease burden of influenza including estimates of the total number of flu illnesses in the united states more information regarding these preliminary inseason burden estimates is available for more information on cdc surveillance systems see cdcs overview of influenza surveillance in the united states how many people are hospitalized from flu every year cdc conducts surveillance for flurelated hospitalizations through the influenza hospitalization surveillance network flusurvnet a collaboration between cdc the emerging infections program and additional influenza hospitalization surveillance project ihsp states in 13 geographically distributed areas in the united states the network includes hospitals that serve roughly 9 percent of the us population the data collected through flusurvnet allows cdc to calculate an overall hospitalization rate as well as by age group but this system does not provide the total number of flu hospitalizations that actually occur in the united states reported flusurvnet hospitalization rates are adjusted to correct for underdetection which is calculated from the percent of persons hospitalized with respiratory illness who were tested for influenza and the average sensitivity of influenza tests used in the participating flusurvnet surveillance hospitals cdc uses these methods to estimate the true burden of flu hospitalizations in the united states since 2010 cdc estimates that flu has resulted in between 140000 and 960000 hospitalizations each year for more information on these estimates see cdcs disease burden of influenza page during the 20182019 flu season cdc began reporting cumulative inseason estimates of disease burden of influenza including estimates of the total number of people hospitalized in the united states from flu more information regarding these preliminary inseason burden estimates is available for more information on cdc surveillance systems see cdcs overview of influenza surveillance in the united states how many adults die from flu each year flu deaths in adults are not nationally notifiable in order to monitor influenza related deaths in all age groups cdc tracks pneumonia and influenza piattributed deaths through the national center for health statistics nchs mortality reporting system this system tracks the proportion of death certificates processed that list pneumonia or influenza as the underlying or contributing cause of death this system provides an overall indication of whether fluassociated deaths are elevated but does not provide an exact number of how many people died from flu as it does for the numbers of flu cases doctors visits and hospitalizations cdc also estimates deaths in the united states using mathematical modeling cdc estimates that from 20102011 to 20172018 influenzaassociated deaths in the united states ranged from a low of 12000 during 20112012 to a high of 79000 during 20172018 the model used to estimate fluassociated deaths uses a ratio of deathstohospitalizations in order to estimate the total flurelated deaths during a season for more information how cdc estimates burden as data allow cdc will begin reporting cumulative inseason estimates of the influenza mortality burden more information regarding these preliminary inseason burden estimates is available for more information overview of influenza surveillance in the united states mortality surveillance how many children die from flu each year influenzaassociated deaths in children people younger than 18 became nationally reportable in 2004 since that time the number of pediatric flu deaths reported to cdc each year has ranged from 37 20112012 season to 185 deaths 20172018 season its important to note that the actual number of flu deaths in children is thought to be higher than what is reported by states to cdc because not all flu deaths in children are detectedreported cdc also estimates the numbers of flurelated deaths using statistical models estimates of deaths in children since 2010 have ranged from 37 20112012 to about 1200 20122013 cdc believes these estimated numbers of pediatric deaths are likely a better estimate of the number of pediatric flu deaths for more information on these estimates see cdcs disease burden of influenza page why is it difficult to know exactly how many people die from flu there are several factors that make it difficult to determine accurate numbers of deaths caused by flu regardless of reporting some of the challenges in counting flu associated deaths include the following the sheer volume of deaths to be counted the lack of testing not everyone that dies with an influenzalike illness is tested for influenza and the different coding of deaths influenzaassociated deaths often are a result of complications secondary to underlying medical problems and this may be difficult to sort out for more information estimating seasonal influenzaassociated deaths in the united states top of page protective actions what should i do to protect myself from flu this season cdc recommends a yearly flu vaccine for everyone 6 months of age and older as the first and most important step in protecting against this serious disease in addition to getting a seasonal flu vaccine you can take everyday preventive actions like staying away from sick people and washing your hands to reduce the spread of germs if you are sick with flu stay home from work or school to prevent spreading flu to others in addition there are prescription medications called antiviral drugs that can be used to treat influenza illness what should i do to protect my loved ones from flu this season encourage your loved ones to get vaccinated vaccination is especially important for people at high risk for developing flu complications and their close contacts also if you have a loved one who is at high risk of flu complications and they develop flu symptoms encourage them to get a medical evaluation for possible

weeks apart where can i get a flu vaccine flu vaccines are offered by many doctors offices clinics health departments pharmacies and college health centers as well as by many employers and even by some schools even if you dont have a regular doctor or nurse you can get a flu vaccine somewhere else like a health department pharmacy urgent care clinic and often your school college health center or work the healthmap vaccine finder helps you to locate where you can get a flu vaccine what is flu vaccination using a jet injector the us food and drug administration fda has approved two influenza vaccines afluria and afluria quadrivalent for administration by a jet injector device the pharmajet stratis 05ml needlefree jet injector for people 18 through 64 years of age these are the only two influenza vaccines approved for administration by jet injector people aged 18 through 64 years may receive these vaccines either by jet injector or needle a jet injector is a medical device used for vaccination that uses a highpressure narrow stream of fluid to penetrate the skin instead of a hypodermic needle more information about flu vaccination by jet injector is available what is adjuvanted flu vaccine the us food and drug administration fda licensed a seasonal influenza flu vaccine containing adjuvant for adults 65 years of age and older an adjuvant is an ingredient added to a vaccine to create a stronger immune response to vaccination fluad was licensed in november 2015 and will be available during the 20182019 flu season it contains the mf59 adjuvant an oilinwater emulsion of squalene oil fluad is the first adjuvanted seasonal flu vaccine marketed in the united states how long does a flu vaccine protect me from getting flu multiple studies conducted over different seasons and across flu vaccine types and influenza virus subtypes have shown that the bodys immunity to influenza viruses acquired either through natural infection or vaccination declines over time the decline in antibodies is influenced by several factors including the antigen used in the vaccine the age of the person being vaccinated and the persons general health for example certain chronic health conditions may have an impact on immunity older people and others with weakened immune systems may not generate the same amount of antibodies after vaccination further their antibody levels may drop more quickly when compared to young healthy people getting vaccinated each year provides the best protection against flu throughout flu season its important to get a flu vaccine every season even if you got vaccinated the season before and the viruses in the flu vaccine have not changed for the current season can i get vaccinated and still get the flu yes its possible to get sick with flu even if you have been vaccinated although you wont know for sure unless you get a flu test this is possible for the following reasons you may be exposed to a flu virus shortly before getting vaccinated or during the period that it takes the body to gain protection after getting vaccinated this exposure may result in you becoming ill with flu before the vaccine begins to protect you antibodies that provide protection develop in the body about 2 weeks after vaccination you may be exposed to a flu virus that is not included in the seasonal flu vaccine there are many different flu viruses that circulate every year a flu vaccine is made to protect against the three or four flu viruses that research suggests will be most common unfortunately some people can become infected with a flu virus a flu vaccine is designed to protect against despite getting vaccinated protection provided by flu vaccination can vary widely based in part on health and age factors of the person getting vaccinated in general a flu vaccine works best among healthy younger adults and older children some older people and people with certain chronic illnesses may develop less immunity after vaccination flu vaccination is not a perfect tool but it is the best way to protect against flu infection top of page flu vaccine effectiveness how effective will flu vaccines be this season influenza vaccine effectiveness ve can vary from season to season and among different age and risk groups and even by vaccine type how well the vaccine works can depend in part on the match between the vaccine viruses used to produce vaccine and circulating viruses that season its not possible to predict in advance what flu viruses will predominate cdc monitors circulating viruses throughout the year and provides new and updated information about their similarity to flu vaccine viruses as it becomes available information is published weekly in fluview and summarized at intervals in the morbidity and mortality weekly report mmwr vaccine effectiveness estimates are also provided when they become available while vaccine effectiveness can vary recent studies show vaccine reduces the risk of flu illness by about 40 to 60 among the overall population during seasons when most circulating flu viruses are like the vaccine viruses similar reductions against hospitalization have been observed too more information about previous vaccine effectiveness is available will this seasons flu vaccine be a good match for circulating viruses its not possible to predict with certainty if a flu vaccine will be a good match for circulating flu viruses a flu vaccine is made to protect against the flu viruses that research and surveillance indicate will likely be most common during the season however experts must pick which flu viruses to include in a flu vaccine many months in advance in order for flu vaccines to be produced and delivered on time also flu viruses change constantly called drift they can change from one season to the next or they can even change within the course of one flu season another factor that can impact vaccine effectiveness especially against influenza ah3n2 viruses are changes that can occur in vaccine viruses as they are grown in eggs which is the production method for most current flu vaccines because of these factors there is always the possibility of a less than optimal match between circulating flu viruses and the viruses in a flu vaccine over the course of flu season cdc studies samples of circulating flu viruses to evaluate how close a match there is between viruses used to make the flu vaccine and circulating flu viruses one of the ways that helps cdc evaluate the match between flu vaccine viruses and circulating flu viruses is with a lab process called genetic and antigenic characterization results of genetic and antigenic characterization testing are published weekly in cdcs fluview can a flu vaccine provide protection even if the flu vaccine is not a good match yes antibodies made in response to vaccination with one flu virus can sometimes provide protection against different but related flu viruses a less than ideal match may result in reduced vaccine effectiveness against the flu virus that is different from what is in the flu vaccine but it might still provide some protection against flu illness in addition its important to remember that a flu vaccine contains three or four flu viruses depending on the type of vaccine you receive so that even when there is a less than ideal match or lower effectiveness against one virus a flu vaccine may protect against the other flu viruses for these reasons even during seasons when there is a less than ideal match cdc continues to recommend flu vaccination for everyone 6 months and older vaccination is particularly important for people at high risk for serious flu complications and their close contacts top of page if you get sick what happens in the body when someone has flu influenza viruses usually infect the respiratory tract ie the airways of the nose throat and lungs as the infection progresses the bodys immune system responds to fight the virus this results in inflammation that can trigger respiratory symptoms such as cough and sore throat the immune system response can also trigger fever and cause muscle or body aches when infected persons cough sneeze or talk they can spread influenza viruses in respiratory droplets to people who are nearby people might also get flu by touching a contaminated surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth or nose most people who become sick will recover in a few days to less than two weeks but some people may become more severely ill following flu infection moderate complications such as secondary ear and sinus infections can occur pneumonia is a serious flu complication that can result from either influenza virus infection alone or from coinfection of flu virus and bacteria other possible serious complications triggered by flu can include inflammation of the heart myocarditis brain encephalitis or muscle myositis rhabdomyolysis tissues and multiorgan failure for example respiratory and kidney failure severe complications can happen to anyone but may be more likely to happen to people who have certain chronic medical conditions or in elderly persons what should i do if i get sick with flu most people with flu have mild illness and do not need medical care or antiviral drugs if you get sick with flu symptoms in most cases you should stay home and avoid contact with other people except to get medical care if however you have symptoms of flu and are at high risk of flu complications or are very sick or concerned about your illness contact your health care provider there are drugs your doctor may prescribe for treating flu called antivirals these drugs can make you better faster and may also prevent serious complications antiviral drugs are prescription drugs that can be used to treat flu illness people at high risk of serious flu complications recommended for prompt antiviral treatment include children younger than 2 years of age although all children younger than 5 years are considered at higher risk for complications from influenza the highest risk is for those younger than 2 years of age adults 65 years of age and older pregnant women people with certain longterm medical conditions and residents of nursing homes and other longterm care facilities antiviral treatment as early as possible is also recommended for people who are very sick with flu such as those with complicated progressive illness or people hospitalized because of flu other people can be treated with antivirals at their health care professionals discretion treating high risk people or people who are very sick with flu with antiviral drugs is very important studies show that prompt treatment with antiviral drugs can prevent serious flu complications prompt treatment can mean the difference between having a milder illness versus very serious illness that could result in a hospital stay treatment with antivirals works best when begun within 48 hours of getting sick but can still be beneficial when given later in the course of illness antiviral drugs are effective across all age and risk groups studies show that antiviral drugs are underprescribed for people who are at high risk of complications who get flu four fdaapproved antiviral medications are recommended for use during the 20182019 flu season oseltamivir available in generic versions and under the trade name tamiflu zanamivir relenza peramivir rapivab and baloxavir marboxil xofluza more information about antiviral drugs can be found at treatment  antiviral drugs this guidance is consistent with the 20182019 flu season recommendations published by the infectious diseases society of america idsa on december 19 in clinical infectious diseases the flu what to do if you get sick what is baloxavir marboxil baloxavir marboxil trade name xofluza is an influenza singledose antiviral drug approved october 24 2018 by the food and drug administration fda baloxavir is approved for the treatment of acute uncomplicated flu in people 12 years and older who have had flu symptoms for less than 48 hours in clinical randomized trials baloxavir was similar to oseltamivir a currently recommended flu antiviral drug in alleviating flu symptoms more information regarding baloxaviris available influenza antiviral drug baloxavir marboxil top of page surveillance how does cdc track flu activity the epidemiology and prevention branch in the influenza division at cdc collects compiles and analyzes information on flu activity year round in the united states and produces fluview a weekly influenza surveillance report and fluview interactive which allows for more indepth exploration of influenza surveillance data the us influenza surveillance system is a collaborative effort between cdc and its many partners in state local and territorial health departments public health and clinical laboratories vital statistics offices healthcare providers clinics and emergency departments information in five categories is collected from eight different data sources that allow cdc to find out when and where influenza activity is occurring track influenzarelated illness determine what influenza viruses are circulating detect changes in influenza viruses measure the impact influenza is having on hospitalizations and deaths in the united states for more information visit overview of influenza surveillance in the united states what will cdc do to monitor flu vaccine effectiveness for the 20182019 season cdc collaborates with partners each season to assess how well the seasonal flu vaccines are working during the 20182019 season cdc is planning multiple studies on the effectiveness of flu shots these studies measure vaccine effectiveness in preventing laboratoryconfirmed influenza among persons 6 months of age and older a summary of cdcs latest vaccine effectiveness estimates is available at seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness 20052018 what is cdc doing to monitor antiviral resistance in the united states during the 20182019 season antiviral resistance means that a virus has changed in such a way that antiviral drugs are less effective or not effective at all in treating or preventing illnesses with that virus cdc will continue to collect and monitor flu viruses for changes through an established network of domestic and global surveillance systems cdc also is working with the state public health departments and the world health organization to collect additional information on antiviral resistance in the united states and worldwide the information collected will assist in making informed recommendations regarding use of antiviral drugs to treat influenza how does cdc estimate the burden of seasonal flu on the united states the burden of influenza on the united states can vary widely from season to season and is determined by a number of factors including the characteristics of circulating viruses the timing of the season population immunity to circulating viruses how well flu vaccines are working and how many people have gotten vaccinated while the impact of flu varies it places a substantial burden on the health of people in the united states each year cdc uses a model to estimate the numbers of influenza illnesses medical visits and hospitalizations in the united states as well as the impact of influenza vaccination on these numbers the same model is also extended to estimate flurelated deaths in the united states this methodology has been used to retroactively calculate influenza burden including deaths going back to 2010 starting with the 20182019 flu season cdc will report cumulative inseason estimates of the burden of influenza these preliminary inseason burden estimates will be updated weekly over the course of the flu season how does cdc classify flu season severity in 2017 cdc adopted and outlined a new methodology for determining flu season severity based on data from past flu seasons cdc researchers used key flu indicator data to develop intensity thresholds its to classify the severity of flu seasons based on the intensity thresholds cdc researchers classified seasonal severity from 20032004 through the 20172018 flu seasons overall four seasons were classified as low severity seven as moderate two as high and none as very high what is flu forecasting influenza flu places a significant disease burden on the us population each year but the magnitude and timing varies from season to season making the annual impact difficult to predict at the beginning of each season flu forecasting can change that by predicting in advance when the start peak and increases in flu activity will occur unlike cdcs traditional influenza surveillance systems which measure influenza activity after it has occurred flu forecasting offers the possibility to look into the future and better plan ahead potentially reducing the impact of flu \n"

      "Whats new this flu season A few things are new this season Flu vaccines have been updated to better match circulating viruses the BVictoria component was changed and the influenza AH3N2 component was updated For the 20182019 season the nasal spray flu vaccine live attenuated influenza vaccine or LAIV is again a recommended option for influenza vaccination of persons for whom it is otherwise appropriate The nasal spray is approved for use in nonpregnant individuals 2 to 49 years old There is a precaution against the use of LAIV for people with certain underlying medical conditions All LAIV will be quadrivalent fourcomponent Most regulardose eggbased flu shots will be quadrivalent All recombinant vaccine will be quadrivalent No trivalent recombinant vaccine will be available this season Cellgrown flu vaccine will be quadrivalent For this vaccine the influenza AH3N2 and both influenza B reference viruses will be cellderived and the influenza AH1N1 will be eggderived All these reference viruses will be grown in cells to produce the components of Flucelvax No intradermal flu vaccine will be available The age recommendation for Fluarix Quadrivalent was changed from 3 years and older to 6 months and older after the annual recommendations were published last season to be consistent with Food and Drug Administration FDAapproved labeling The age recommendation for Afluria Quadrivalent was changed from 18 years and older to 5 years and older after the annual recommendations were published last season to be consistent with Food and Drug Administration FDAapproved labeling Baloxavir marboxil trade name Xofluza is a new influenza singledose antiviral drug approved October 24 2018 by the Food and Drug Administration FDA Baloxavir is approved for the treatment of acute uncomplicated flu in people 12 years and older who have had flu symptoms for less than 48 hours More information is available Influenza Antiviral Drug Baloxavir Marboxil CDC is reporting inseason estimates of the cumulative number of flu illnesses medical visits and hospitalizations in the US These Preliminary InSeason Burden Estimates will be updated weekly over the course of the flu season What flu vaccines are recommended this season For the 20182019 flu season providers may choose to administer any licensed ageappropriate flu vaccine IIV RIV4 or LAIV4 Options this season include Standard dose flu shots These are given into the muscle They are usually given with a needle but two Afluria and Afluria Quadrivalent can be given to some people those 18 to 64 years old with a jet injector Highdose shots for older people Shots made with adjuvant for older people Shots made with virus grown in cell culture Shots made using a vaccine production technology recombinant vaccine that does not require the use of flu virus Live attenuated influenza vaccine LAIV  or the nasal spray vaccine  is also an option for use during the 20182019 season for persons whom it is otherwise appropriate There is a table showing all flu vaccines that are FDAapproved for use in the United States during the 20182019 season What viruses will the 20182019 flu vaccines protect against There are many different flu viruses and they are constantly changing The composition of US flu vaccines is reviewed annually and updated as needed to match circulating flu viruses Flu vaccines protect against the three or four viruses depending on vaccine that research suggests will be most common For 20182019 trivalent threecomponent vaccines are recommended to contain AMichigan452015 H1N1pdm09like virus ASingaporeINFIMH1600192016 AH3N2like virus updated BColorado062017like Victoria lineage virus updated Quadrivalent fourcomponent vaccines which protect against a second lineage of B viruses are recommended to contain the three recommended viruses above plus BPhuket30732013like Yamagata lineage virus When should I get vaccinated You should get a flu vaccine before flu begins spreading in your community It takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies that protect against flu to develop in the body so make plans to get vaccinated early in fall before flu season begins CDC recommends that people get a flu vaccine by the end of October Getting vaccinated later however can still be beneficial and vaccination should continue to be offered throughout flu season even into January or later Children who need two doses of vaccine to be protected should start the vaccination process sooner because the two doses must be given at least four weeks apart Can I get a flu vaccine if I am allergic to eggs The recommendations for people with egg allergies are the same as last season People who have experienced only hives after exposure to egg can get any licensed flu vaccine that is otherwise appropriate for their age and health People who have symptoms other than hives after exposure to eggs such as angioedema respiratory distress lightheadedness or recurrent emesis or who have needed epinephrine or another emergency medical intervention can also get any licensed flu vaccine that is otherwise appropriate for their age and health but the vaccine should be given in a medical setting and be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic conditions Settings include hospitals clinics health departments and physician offices People with egg allergies no longer have to wait 30 minutes after receiving their vaccine Implications of CellBased Vaccines Why is it significant that cellgrown vaccine reference viruses are used to produce some components of one type of flu vaccine Cellgrown reference viruses do not have the changes that are present in egggrown reference viruses so they should be more similar to circulating wildtype viruses Vaccine effectiveness depends in part on the match between the vaccine virus and circulating flu viruses Is flu vaccine made using a cellgrown reference virus and cellbased technology more effective than vaccine made using an egggrown reference virus and eggbased technology While the use of cellgrown reference viruses and cellbased technology may offer the potential for better protection over traditional eggbased flu vaccines because they result in vaccine viruses that are more similar to flu viruses in circulation there are no data yet to support this There is no preferential recommendation for one injectable flu vaccine over another Top of Page Flu Activity What sort of flu season is expected this year It is not possible to predict what this flu season will be like While flu spreads every year the timing severity and length of the season varies from one season to another Will new flu viruses circulate this season Flu viruses are constantly changing so its not unusual for new flu viruses to appear each year More information about how flu viruses change is available Will the United States have a flu epidemic The United States experiences annual epidemics of seasonal flu This time of year is called flu season In the United States flu viruses are most common during the fall and winter months Influenza activity often begins to increase in October and November Most of the time flu activity peaks between December and February and it can last as late as May CDC monitors certain key flu indicators for example outpatient visits of influenzalike illness ILI the results of laboratory testing and reports of flu hospitalizations and deaths When these indicators rise and remain elevated for a number of consecutive weeks flu season is said to have begun Usually ILI increases first followed by an increase in fluassociated hospitalizations which is then followed by increases in fluassociated deaths For the most current influenza surveillance information Weekly US Influenza Surveillance Report When will flu activity begin and when will it peak The timing of flu is unpredictable and can vary in different parts of the country and from season to season Seasonal flu viruses can be detected yearround however seasonal flu activity often begins as early as October and November and can continue to occur as late as May Flu activity most commonly peaks in the United States between December and February How many people get sick with flu every year CDC conducts surveillance for people who see their health care provider for flulike illness through the Outpatient Influenzalike Illness Surveillance Network ILINet a network of thousands of health care providers who report the proportion of patients seeking care for flulike illness weekly to CDC This system allows CDC to track levels of medically attended flulike illness over the course of the flu season CDC does not know exactly how many people get sick with seasonal flu each year There are several reasons for this including that ILINet does not include every health care provider and monitors flulike illness not laboratoryconfirmed influenza cases Also flu illness is not a reportable disease and not everyone who gets sick with flu seeks medical care or gets tested CDC uses mathematical modeling in combination with data from traditional flu surveillance systems to estimate the numbers of flu illnesses in the United States CDC estimates that flu has resulted in between 93 million and 49 million illnesses each year in the United States since 2010 More information on these estimates is available on CDCs Disease Burden of Influenza page During the 20182019 flu season CDC began reporting cumulative inseason estimates of the disease burden of influenza including estimates of the total number of flu illnesses in the United States More information regarding these Preliminary InSeason Burden Estimates is available For more information on CDC surveillance systems see CDCs Overview of Influenza Surveillance in the United States How many people are hospitalized from flu every year CDC conducts surveillance for flurelated hospitalizations through the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network FluSurvNET a collaboration between CDC the Emerging Infections Program and additional Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Project IHSP states in 13 geographically distributed areas in the United States The network includes hospitals that serve roughly 9 percent of the US population The data collected through FluSurvNET allows CDC to calculate an overall hospitalization rate as well as by age group but this system does not provide the total number of flu hospitalizations that actually occur in the United States Reported FluSurvNET hospitalization rates are adjusted to correct for underdetection which is calculated from the percent of persons hospitalized with respiratory illness who were tested for influenza and the average sensitivity of influenza tests used in the participating FluSurvNET surveillance hospitals CDC uses these methods to estimate the true burden of flu hospitalizations in the United States Since 2010 CDC estimates that flu has resulted in between 140000 and 960000 hospitalizations each year For more information on these estimates see CDCs Disease Burden of Influenza page During the 20182019 flu season CDC began reporting cumulative inseason estimates of disease burden of influenza including estimates of the total number of people hospitalized in the United States from flu More information regarding these Preliminary InSeason Burden Estimates is available For more information on CDC surveillance systems see CDCs Overview of Influenza Surveillance in the United States How many adults die from flu each year Flu deaths in adults are not nationally notifiable In order to monitor influenza related deaths in all age groups CDC tracks pneumonia and influenza PIattributed deaths through the National Center for Health Statistics NCHS Mortality Reporting System This system tracks the proportion of death certificates processed that list pneumonia or influenza as the underlying or contributing cause of death This system provides an overall indication of whether fluassociated deaths are elevated but does not provide an exact number of how many people died from flu As it does for the numbers of flu cases doctors visits and hospitalizations CDC also estimates deaths in the United States using mathematical modeling CDC estimates that from 20102011 to 20172018 influenzaassociated deaths in the United States ranged from a low of 12000 during 20112012 to a high of 79000 during 20172018 The model used to estimate fluassociated deaths uses a ratio of deathstohospitalizations in order to estimate the total flurelated deaths during a season For more information How CDC Estimates Burden As data allow CDC will begin reporting cumulative inseason estimates of the influenza mortality burden More information regarding these Preliminary InSeason Burden Estimates is available For more information Overview of Influenza Surveillance in the United States Mortality Surveillance How many children die from flu each year Influenzaassociated deaths in children people younger than 18 became nationally reportable in 2004 Since that time the number of pediatric flu deaths reported to CDC each year has ranged from 37 20112012 season to 185 deaths 20172018 season Its important to note that the actual number of flu deaths in children is thought to be higher than what is reported by states to CDC because not all flu deaths in children are detectedreported CDC also estimates the numbers of flurelated deaths using statistical models Estimates of deaths in children since 2010 have ranged from 37 20112012 to about 1200 20122013 CDC believes these estimated numbers of pediatric deaths are likely a better estimate of the number of pediatric flu deaths For more information on these estimates see CDCs Disease Burden of Influenza page Why is it difficult to know exactly how many people die from flu There are several factors that make it difficult to determine accurate numbers of deaths caused by flu regardless of reporting Some of the challenges in counting flu associated deaths include the following the sheer volume of deaths to be counted the lack of testing not everyone that dies with an influenzalike illness is tested for influenza and the different coding of deaths influenzaassociated deaths often are a result of complications secondary to underlying medical problems and this may be difficult to sort out For more information Estimating Seasonal InfluenzaAssociated Deaths in the United States Top of Page Protective Actions What should I do to protect myself from flu this season CDC recommends a yearly flu vaccine for everyone 6 months of age and older as the first and most important step in protecting against this serious disease In addition to getting a seasonal flu vaccine you can take everyday preventive actions like staying away from sick people and washing your hands to reduce the spread of germs If you are sick with flu stay home from work or school to prevent spreading flu to others In addition there are prescription medications called antiviral drugs that can be used to treat influenza illness What should I do to protect my loved ones from flu this season Encourage your loved ones to get vaccinated Vaccination is especially important for people at high risk for developing flu complications and their close contacts Also if you have a loved one who is at high risk of flu complications and they develop flu symptoms encourage them to get a medical evaluation for possible treatment with flu antiviral drugs These drugs work best if given within 48 hours of when symptoms start CDC recommends that people who are at high risk for serious flu complications and who get flu symptoms during flu season be treated with flu antiviral drugs as quickly as possible without waiting for confirmatory testing People who are not at high risk for serious flu complications may also be treated with flu antiviral drugs especially if treatment can begin within 48 hours Do some children require two doses of flu vaccine Yes Some children 6 months through 8 years of age will require two doses of flu vaccine for adequate protection from flu Children in this age group who are getting vaccinated for the first time will need two doses of flu vaccine spaced at least 4 weeks apart Children who have only received one dose in their lifetime also need two doses Your childs doctor or other health care professional can tell you if your child needs two doses of flu vaccine What can I do to protect children who are too young to get vaccinated Children younger than 6 months old are at high risk of serious flu complications but are too young to get a flu vaccine Because of this safeguarding them from flu is especially important If you live with or care for an infant younger than 6 months old you should get a flu vaccine to help protect them from flu Advice for Caregivers of Young Children is available for more information Everyone else who is around the baby also should be vaccinated Also studies have shown that flu vaccination of the mother during pregnancy can protect the baby after birth from flu infection for several months In addition to getting vaccinated you and your loved ones can take everyday preventive actions like staying away from sick people and washing your hands to reduce the spread of germs If you are sick with flu stay home from work or school to prevent spreading flu to others Top of Page Vaccine and Vaccination How much flu vaccine will be available this season Flu vaccine is produced by private manufacturers so supply depends on manufacturers For the 20182019 season manufacturers projected they would provide between 163 million and 168 million doses of injectable vaccine for the US market Projections may change as the season progresses Flu vaccine supply updates will be provided as they become available at Seasonal Influenza Vaccine  Total Doses Distributed Are any of the available flu vaccines recommended over the others For the 20182019 flu season ACIP recommends annual influenza vaccination for everyone 6 months and older with any licensed ageappropriate flu vaccine IIV RIV4 or LAIV4 with no preference expressed for any one vaccine over another There are many vaccine options to choose from the most important thing is for all people 6 months and older to get a flu vaccine every year If you have questions about which vaccine is best for you talk to your doctor or other health care professional Why is the nasal spray being recommended as an option this year when it has been shown to not be effective in past flu seasons While observational data from 201011 through 201516 flu seasons indicate that LAIV was not effective among 2 through 17yearolds against H1N1pdm09 influenza viruses in the US LAIV was effective against influenza B viruses and was similarly effective to inactivated influenza vaccines against H3N2 viruses Some data suggest that the new H1N1 vaccine virus included in the new LAIV vaccines will have improved effectiveness against circulating H1N1 viruses however no published effectiveness estimates are available yet When should I get vaccinated Getting vaccinated before flu activity begins helps protect you once flu season starts in your community It takes about two weeks after vaccination for the bodys immune response to fully respond and for you to be protected so make plans to get vaccinated CDC recommends that people get a flu vaccine by the end of October However getting vaccinated later can still be beneficial CDC recommends ongoing flu vaccination as long as influenza viruses are circulating even into January or later Children 6 months to 8 years old who need two doses of vaccine should get the first dose as soon after vaccine is available to allow time to get the second dose before the start of flu season The two doses should be given at least 4 weeks apart Where can I get a flu vaccine Flu vaccines are offered by many doctors offices clinics health departments pharmacies and college health centers as well as by many employers and even by some schools Even if you dont have a regular doctor or nurse you can get a flu vaccine somewhere else like a health department pharmacy urgent care clinic and often your school college health center or work The HealthMap Vaccine Finder helps you to locate where you can get a flu vaccine What is flu vaccination using a jet injector The US Food and Drug Administration FDA has approved two influenza vaccines Afluria and Afluria Quadrivalent for administration by a jet injector device the PharmaJet Stratis 05ml Needlefree Jet Injector for people 18 through 64 years of age These are the only two influenza vaccines approved for administration by jet injector People aged 18 through 64 years may receive these vaccines either by jet injector or needle A jet injector is a medical device used for vaccination that uses a highpressure narrow stream of fluid to penetrate the skin instead of a hypodermic needle More information about Flu Vaccination by Jet Injector is available What is adjuvanted flu vaccine The US Food and Drug Administration FDA licensed a seasonal influenza flu vaccine containing adjuvant for adults 65 years of age and older An adjuvant is an ingredient added to a vaccine to create a stronger immune response to vaccination FLUAD was licensed in November 2015 and will be available during the 20182019 flu season It contains the MF59 adjuvant an oilinwater emulsion of squalene oil FLUAD is the first adjuvanted seasonal flu vaccine marketed in the United States How long does a flu vaccine protect me from getting flu Multiple studies conducted over different seasons and across flu vaccine types and influenza virus subtypes have shown that the bodys immunity to influenza viruses acquired either through natural infection or vaccination declines over time The decline in antibodies is influenced by several factors including the antigen used in the vaccine the age of the person being vaccinated and the persons general health for example certain chronic health conditions may have an impact on immunity Older people and others with weakened immune systems may not generate the same amount of antibodies after vaccination further their antibody levels may drop more quickly when compared to young healthy people Getting vaccinated each year provides the best protection against flu throughout flu season Its important to get a flu vaccine every season even if you got vaccinated the season before and the viruses in the flu vaccine have not changed for the current season Can I get vaccinated and still get the flu Yes Its possible to get sick with flu even if you have been vaccinated although you wont know for sure unless you get a flu test This is possible for the following reasons You may be exposed to a flu virus shortly before getting vaccinated or during the period that it takes the body to gain protection after getting vaccinated This exposure may result in you becoming ill with flu before the vaccine begins to protect you Antibodies that provide protection develop in the body about 2 weeks after vaccination You may be exposed to a flu virus that is not included in the seasonal flu vaccine There are many different flu viruses that circulate every year A flu vaccine is made to protect against the three or four flu viruses that research suggests will be most common Unfortunately some people can become infected with a flu virus a flu vaccine is designed to protect against despite getting vaccinated Protection provided by flu vaccination can vary widely based in part on health and age factors of the person getting vaccinated In general a flu vaccine works best among healthy younger adults and older children Some older people and people with certain chronic illnesses may develop less immunity after vaccination Flu vaccination is not a perfect tool but it is the best way to protect against flu infection Top of Page Flu Vaccine Effectiveness How effective will flu vaccines be this season Influenza vaccine effectiveness VE can vary from season to season and among different age and risk groups and even by vaccine type How well the vaccine works can depend in part on the match between the vaccine viruses used to produce vaccine and circulating viruses that season Its not possible to predict in advance what flu viruses will predominate CDC monitors circulating viruses throughout the year and provides new and updated information about their similarity to flu vaccine viruses as it becomes available Information is published weekly in FluView and summarized at intervals in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report MMWR Vaccine effectiveness estimates are also provided when they become available While vaccine effectiveness can vary recent studies show vaccine reduces the risk of flu illness by about 40 to 60 among the overall population during seasons when most circulating flu viruses are like the vaccine viruses Similar reductions against hospitalization have been observed too More information about previous vaccine effectiveness is available Will this seasons flu vaccine be a good match for circulating viruses Its not possible to predict with certainty if a flu vaccine will be a good match for circulating flu viruses A flu vaccine is made to protect against the flu viruses that research and surveillance indicate will likely be most common during the season However experts must pick which flu viruses to include in a flu vaccine many months in advance in order for flu vaccines to be produced and delivered on time Also flu viruses change constantly called drift They can change from one season to the next or they can even change within the course of one flu season Another factor that can impact vaccine effectiveness especially against influenza AH3N2 viruses are changes that can occur in vaccine viruses as they are grown in eggs which is the production method for most current flu vaccines Because of these factors there is always the possibility of a less than optimal match between circulating flu viruses and the viruses in a flu vaccine Over the course of flu season CDC studies samples of circulating flu viruses to evaluate how close a match there is between viruses used to make the flu vaccine and circulating flu viruses One of the ways that helps CDC evaluate the match between flu vaccine viruses and circulating flu viruses is with a lab process called genetic and antigenic characterization Results of genetic and antigenic characterization testing are published weekly in CDCs FluView Can a flu vaccine provide protection even if the flu vaccine is not a good match Yes antibodies made in response to vaccination with one flu virus can sometimes provide protection against different but related flu viruses A less than ideal match may result in reduced vaccine effectiveness against the flu virus that is different from what is in the flu vaccine but it might still provide some protection against flu illness In addition its important to remember that a flu vaccine contains three or four flu viruses depending on the type of vaccine you receive so that even when there is a less than ideal match or lower effectiveness against one virus a flu vaccine may protect against the other flu viruses For these reasons even during seasons when there is a less than ideal match CDC continues to recommend flu vaccination for everyone 6 months and older Vaccination is particularly important for people at high risk for serious flu complications and their close contacts Top of Page If You Get Sick What happens in the body when someone has flu Influenza viruses usually infect the respiratory tract ie the airways of the nose throat and lungs As the infection progresses the bodys immune system responds to fight the virus This results in inflammation that can trigger respiratory symptoms such as cough and sore throat The immune system response can also trigger fever and cause muscle or body aches When infected persons cough sneeze or talk they can spread influenza viruses in respiratory droplets to people who are nearby People might also get flu by touching a contaminated surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth or nose Most people who become sick will recover in a few days to less than two weeks but some people may become more severely ill Following flu infection moderate complications such as secondary ear and sinus infections can occur Pneumonia is a serious flu complication that can result from either influenza virus infection alone or from coinfection of flu virus and bacteria Other possible serious complications triggered by flu can include inflammation of the heart myocarditis brain encephalitis or muscle myositis rhabdomyolysis tissues and multiorgan failure for example respiratory and kidney failure Severe complications can happen to anyone but may be more likely to happen to people who have certain chronic medical conditions or in elderly persons What should I do if I get sick with flu Most people with flu have mild illness and do not need medical care or antiviral drugs If you get sick with flu symptoms in most cases you should stay home and avoid contact with other people except to get medical care If however you have symptoms of flu and are at high risk of flu complications or are very sick or concerned about your illness contact your health care provider There are drugs your doctor may prescribe for treating flu called antivirals These drugs can make you better faster and may also prevent serious complications Antiviral drugs are prescription drugs that can be used to treat flu illness People at high risk of serious flu complications recommended for prompt antiviral treatment include children younger than 2 years of age although all children younger than 5 years are considered at higher risk for complications from influenza the highest risk is for those younger than 2 years of age adults 65 years of age and older pregnant women people with certain longterm medical conditions and residents of nursing homes and other longterm care facilities Antiviral treatment as early as possible is also recommended for people who are very sick with flu such as those with complicated progressive illness or people hospitalized because of flu Other people can be treated with antivirals at their health care professionals discretion Treating high risk people or people who are very sick with flu with antiviral drugs is very important Studies show that prompt treatment with antiviral drugs can prevent serious flu complications Prompt treatment can mean the difference between having a milder illness versus very serious illness that could result in a hospital stay Treatment with antivirals works best when begun within 48 hours of getting sick but can still be beneficial when given later in the course of illness Antiviral drugs are effective across all age and risk groups Studies show that antiviral drugs are underprescribed for people who are at high risk of complications who get flu Four FDAapproved antiviral medications are recommended for use during the 20182019 flu season oseltamivir available in generic versions and under the trade name Tamiflu zanamivir Relenza peramivir Rapivab and baloxavir marboxil Xofluza More information about antiviral drugs can be found at Treatment  Antiviral Drugs This guidance is consistent with the 20182019 flu season recommendations published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America IDSA on December 19 in Clinical Infectious Diseases The Flu What To Do If You Get Sick What is baloxavir marboxil Baloxavir marboxil trade name Xofluza is an influenza singledose antiviral drug approved October 24 2018 by the Food and Drug Administration FDA Baloxavir is approved for the treatment of acute uncomplicated flu in people 12 years and older who have had flu symptoms for less than 48 hours In clinical randomized trials baloxavir was similar to oseltamivir a currently recommended flu antiviral drug in alleviating flu symptoms More information regarding baloxaviris available Influenza Antiviral Drug Baloxavir Marboxil Top of Page Surveillance How does CDC track flu activity The Epidemiology and Prevention Branch in the Influenza Division at CDC collects compiles and analyzes information on flu activity year round in the United States and produces FluView a weekly influenza surveillance report and FluView Interactive which allows for more indepth exploration of influenza surveillance data The US influenza surveillance system is a collaborative effort between CDC and its many partners in state local and territorial health departments public health and clinical laboratories vital statistics offices healthcare providers clinics and emergency departments Information in five categories is collected from eight different data sources that allow CDC to Find out when and where influenza activity is occurring Track influenzarelated illness Determine what influenza viruses are circulating Detect changes in influenza viruses Measure the impact influenza is having on hospitalizations and deaths in the United States For more information visit Overview of Influenza Surveillance in the United States What will CDC do to monitor flu vaccine effectiveness for the 20182019 season CDC collaborates with partners each season to assess how well the seasonal flu vaccines are working During the 20182019 season CDC is planning multiple studies on the effectiveness of flu shots These studies measure vaccine effectiveness in preventing laboratoryconfirmed influenza among persons 6 months of age and older A summary of CDCs latest vaccine effectiveness estimates is available at Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness 20052018 What is CDC doing to monitor antiviral resistance in the United States during the 20182019 season Antiviral resistance means that a virus has changed in such a way that antiviral drugs are less effective or not effective at all in treating or preventing illnesses with that virus CDC will continue to collect and monitor flu viruses for changes through an established network of domestic and global surveillance systems CDC also is working with the state public health departments and the World Health Organization to collect additional information on antiviral resistance in the United States and worldwide The information collected will assist in making informed recommendations regarding use of antiviral drugs to treat influenza How does CDC estimate the burden of seasonal flu on the United States The burden of influenza on the United States can vary widely from season to season and is determined by a number of factors including the characteristics of circulating viruses the timing of the season population immunity to circulating viruses how well flu vaccines are working and how many people have gotten vaccinated While the impact of flu varies it places a substantial burden on the health of people in the United States each year CDC uses a model to estimate the numbers of influenza illnesses medical visits and hospitalizations in the United States as well as the impact of influenza vaccination on these numbers The same model is also extended to estimate flurelated deaths in the United States This methodology has been used to retroactively calculate influenza burden including deaths going back to 2010 Starting with the 20182019 flu season CDC will report cumulative inseason estimates of the burden of influenza These Preliminary InSeason Burden Estimates will be updated weekly over the course of the flu season How does CDC classify flu season severity In 2017 CDC adopted and outlined a new methodology for determining flu season severity Based on data from past flu seasons CDC researchers used key flu indicator data to develop intensity thresholds ITs to classify the severity of flu seasons Based on the intensity thresholds CDC researchers classified seasonal severity from 20032004 through the 20172018 flu seasons Overall four seasons were classified as low severity seven as moderate two as high and none as very high What is flu forecasting Influenza flu places a significant disease burden on the US population each year but the magnitude and timing varies from season to season making the annual impact difficult to predict at the beginning of each season Flu forecasting can change that by predicting in advance when the start peak and increases in flu activity will occur Unlike CDCs traditional influenza surveillance systems which measure influenza activity after it has occurred flu forecasting offers the possibility to look into the future and better plan ahead potentially reducing the impact of flu \n",

get a flu vaccine before flu begin spread in your community it take about two week after vaccination for antibody that protect against flu to develop in the body so make plan to get vaccinate early in fall before flu season begin cdc recommend that people get a flu vaccine by the end of october getting vaccinate later however can still be beneficial and vaccination should continue to be offer throughout flu season even into january or late child who need two dose of vaccine to be protect should start the vaccination process soon because the two dose must be give at least four week apart can I get a flu vaccine if I be allergic to egg the recommendation for people with egg allergy be the same as last season people who have experience only hive after exposure to egg can get any licensed flu vaccine that be otherwise appropriate for their age and health people who have symptom other than hive after exposure to egg such as angioedema respiratory distress lightheadedness or recurrent emesis or who have need epinephrine or another emergency medical intervention can also get any licensed flu vaccine that be otherwise appropriate for their age and health but the vaccine should be give in a medical setting and be supervise by a health care provider who be able to recognize and manage severe allergic condition setting include hospital clinic health department and physician office people with egg allergy no long have to wait 30 minute after receive their vaccine implication of cellbase vaccine why be it significant that cellgrown vaccine reference virus be use to produce some component of one type of flu vaccine cellgrown reference virus do not have the change that be present in egggrown reference virus so they should be more similar to circulate wildtype virus vaccine effectiveness depend in part on the match between the vaccine virus and circulate flu virus be flu vaccine make use a cellgrown reference virus and cellbase technology more effective than vaccine make use an egggrown reference virus and eggbase technology while the use of cellgrown reference virus and cellbase technology may offer the potential for well protection over traditional eggbase flu vaccine because they result in vaccine virus that be more similar to flu virus in circulation there be no datum yet to support this there be no preferential recommendation for one injectable flu vaccine over another top of page flu activity what sort of flu season be expect this year it be not possible to predict what this flu season will be like while flu spread every year the timing severity and length of the season vary from one season to another will new flu virus circulate this season flu virus be constantly change so its not unusual for new flu virus to appear each year more information about how flu virus change be available will the united states have a flu epidemic the united states experience annual epidemic of seasonal flu this time of year be call flu season in the united states flu virus be most common during the fall and winter month influenza activity often begin to increase in october and november most of the time flu activity peak between december and february and it can last as late as may cdc monitor certain key flu indicator for example outpatient visit of influenzalike illness ili the result of laboratory testing and report of flu hospitalization and death when these indicator rise and remain elevated for a number of consecutive week flu season be say to have begin usually ili increase first follow by an increase in fluassociate hospitalization which be then follow by increase in fluassociate death for the most current influenza surveillance information weekly us influenza surveillance report when will flu activity begin and when will it peak the timing of flu be unpredictable and can vary in different part of the country and from season to season seasonal flu virus can be detect yearround however seasonal flu activity often begin as early as october and november and can continue to occur as late as may flu activity most commonly peak in the united states between december and february how many people get sick with flu every year cdc conduct surveillance for people who see their health care provider for flulike illness through the outpatient influenzalike illness surveillance network ilinet a network of thousand of health care provider who report the proportion of patient seek care for flulike illness weekly to cdc this system allow cdc to track level of medically attend flulike illness over the course of the flu season cdc do not know exactly how many people get sick with seasonal flu each year there be several reason for this include that ilinet do not include every health care provider and monitor flulike illness not laboratoryconfirme influenza case also flu illness be not a reportable disease and not everyone who get sick with flu seek medical care or get test cdc use mathematical modeling in combination with datum from traditional flu surveillance system to estimate the number of flu illness in the united states cdc estimate that flu have result in between 93 million and 49 million illness each year in the united states since 2010 more information on these estimate be available on cdcs disease burden of influenza page during the 20182019 flu season cdc begin report cumulative inseason estimate of the disease burden of influenza include estimate of the total number of flu illness in the united states more information regard these preliminary inseason

conduct surveillance for flurelated hospitalization through the influenza hospitalization surveillance network flusurvnet a collaboration between cdc the emerge infection program and additional influenza hospitalization surveillance project ihsp state in 13 geographically distribute area in the united states the network include hospital that serve roughly 9 percent of the us population the datum collect through flusurvnet allow cdc to calculate an overall hospitalization rate as well as by age group but this system do not provide the total number of flu hospitalization that actually occur in the united states report flusurvnet hospitalization rate be adjust to correct for underdetection which be calculate from the percent of person hospitalize with respiratory illness who be test for influenza and the average sensitivity of influenza test use in the participate flusurvnet surveillance hospital cdc use these method to estimate the true burden of flu hospitalization in the united states since 2010 cdc estimate that flu have result in between 140000 and 960000 hospitalization each year for more information on these estimate see cdcs disease burden of influenza page

more information regard these preliminary inseason burden estimate be available for more information on cdc surveillance system see cdcs overview of influenza surveillance in the united states how many adult die from flu each year flu death in adult be not nationally notifiable in order to monitor influenza relate death in all age group cdc track pneumonia and influenza piattribute death through the national center for health statistic nch mortality reporting system this system track the proportion of death certificate process that list pneumonia or influenza as the underlying or contribute cause of death this system provide an overall indication of whether fluassociate death be elevate but do not provide an exact number of how many people die from flu as it do for the number of flu case doctor visit and hospitalization cdc also estimate death in the united states use mathematical modeling cdc estimate that from 20102011 to 20172018 influenzaassociate death in the united states range from a low of 12000 during 20112012 to a high of 79000 during 20172018 the model use to estimate fluassociate death use a ratio of deathstohospitalization in order to estimate the total

influenzaassociate death in child people young than 18 become nationally reportable in 2004 since that time the number of pediatric flu death report to cdc each year have range from 37 20112012 season to 185 death 20172018 season its important to note that the actual number of flu death in child be think to be high than what be report by state to cdc because not all flu death in child be detectedreporte cdc also estimate the number of flurelated death use statistical model estimate of death in child since 2010 have range from 37 20112012 to about 1200 20122013 cdc believe these estimate number of pediatric death be likely a well estimate of the number of pediatric flu death for more information on these estimate see cdcs disease burden of influenza page why be it difficult to know exactly how many people die from flu there be several factor that make it difficult to determine accurate number of death cause by flu regardless of report some of the challenge in count flu associate death include the follow the sheer volume of death to be count the lack of testing not everyone that die with an influenzalike illness be test for influenza and the different coding of death influenzaassociate death often be a result of complication secondary to underlie medical problem and this may be difficult to sort out for more information estimate seasonal influenzaassociate death in the united states top of page protective action what should I do to protect myself from flu this season cdc recommend a yearly flu vaccine for everyone 6 month of age and old as the first and most important step in protect against this serious disease in addition to get a seasonal flu vaccine you can take everyday preventive action like stay away from sick people and wash your hand to reduce the spread of germ if you be sick with flu stay home from work or school to prevent spread flu to other in addition there be prescription medication call antiviral drug that can be use to treat influenza illness what should I do to protect my love one from flu this season encourage your love one to get vaccinated vaccination be especially important for people at high risk for develop flu complication and their close contact also if you have a love one who be at high risk of flu complication and they develop flu symptom encourage they to get a medical evaluation for possible treatment with flu antiviral drug these drug work well if give within 48 hour of when symptom start cdc recommend that people who be at high risk for serious flu complication and who get flu symptom during flu season be treat with flu antiviral drug as quickly as possible without wait for confirmatory testing people who be not at high risk for serious flu complication may also be treat with flu antiviral drug especially if treatment can begin within 48 hour do some child require two dose of flu vaccine yes some child 6 month through 8 year of age will require two dose of flu vaccine for adequate protection from flu child in this age group who be getting vaccinate for the first time will need two dose of flu vaccine space at least 4 week apart child who have only receive one dose in their lifetime also need two dose your child doctor or other health care professional can tell you if your child need two dose of flu vaccine what can I do to protect child who be too young to get vaccinated child young than 6 month old be at high risk of serious flu complication but be too young to get a flu vaccine because of this safeguard they from flu be especially important if you live with or care for an infant young than 6 month old you should get a flu vaccine to help protect they from flu advice for caregiver of young child be available for more information everyone else who be around the baby also should be vaccinate also study have show that flu vaccination of the mother during pregnancy can protect the baby after birth from flu infection for several month in addition to getting vaccinate you and your love one can take everyday preventive action like stay away from sick people and wash your hand to reduce the spread of germ if you be sick with flu stay home from work or school to prevent spread flu to other top of page vaccine and vaccination how much flu vaccine will be available this season flu vaccine be produce by private manufacturer so supply depend on manufacturer for the 20182019 season manufacturer project they would provide between 163 million and 168 million dose of injectable vaccine for the us market projection may change as the season progress flu vaccine supply update will be provide as they become available at seasonal influenza vaccine   total dose distribute be any of the available flu vaccine recommend over the other for the 20182019 flu season acip recommend annual influenza vaccination for everyone 6 month and old with any licensed ageappropriate flu vaccine iiv riv4 or laiv4 with no preference express for any one vaccine over another there be many vaccine option to choose from the most important thing be for all people 6 month and old to get a flu vaccine every year if you have question about which vaccine be good for you talk to your doctor or other health care professional why be the nasal spray be recommend as an option this year when it have be show to not be effective in past flu season while observational datum from 201011 through 201516 flu season indicate that laiv be not effective among 2 through 17yearolds against h1n1pdm09 influenza virus in the us laiv be effective against influenza b virus and be similarly effective to inactivate influenza vaccine against h3n2 virus some datum suggest that the new h1n1 vaccine virus include in the new laiv vaccine will have improve effectiveness against circulate h1n1 virus however no publish effectiveness estimate be available yet when should I get vaccinated getting vaccinate before flu activity begin help protect you once flu season start in your community it take about two week after vaccination for the bodys immune response to fully respond and for you to be protect so make plan to get vaccinate cdc recommend that people get a flu vaccine by the end of october however getting vaccinate later can still be beneficial cdc recommend ongoing flu vaccination as long as influenza virus be circulate even into january or late child 6 month to 8 year old who need two dose of vaccine should get the first dose as soon after vaccine be available to allow time to get the second dose before the start of flu season the two dose should be give at least 4 week apart where can I get a flu vaccine flu vaccine be offer by many doctor office clinic health department pharmacy and college health center as well as by many employer and even by some school even if you do not have a regular doctor or nurse you can get a flu vaccine somewhere else like a health department pharmacy urgent care clinic and often your school college health center or work the healthmap vaccine finder help you to locate where you can get a flu vaccine what be flu vaccination use a jet injector the us food and drug administration fda have approve two influenza vaccine afluria and afluria quadrivalent for administration by a jet injector device the pharmajet stratis 05ml needlefree jet injector for people 18 through 64 year of age these be the only two influenza vaccine approve for administration by jet injector people age 18 through 64 year may receive these vaccine either by jet injector or needle a jet injector be a medical device use for vaccination that use a highpressure narrow stream of fluid to penetrate the skin instead of a hypodermic needle more information about flu vaccination by jet injector be available what be adjuvante flu vaccine the us food and drug administration fda license a seasonal influenza flu vaccine contain adjuvant for adult 65 year of age and old an adjuvant be an ingredient add to a vaccine to create a strong immune response to vaccination fluad be license in november 2015 and will be available during the 20182019 flu season it contain the mf59 adjuvant an oilinwater emulsion of squalene oil fluad be the first adjuvante seasonal flu vaccine market in the united states how long do a flu vaccine protect I from get flu multiple study conduct over different season and across flu vaccine type and influenza virus subtype have show that the bodys immunity to influenza virus acquire either through natural infection or vaccination decline over time the decline in antibody be influence by several factor include the antigen use in the vaccine the age of the person be vaccinate and the person general health for example certain chronic health condition may have an impact on immunity old people and other with weaken immune system may not generate the same amount of antibody after vaccination far their antibody level may drop more quickly when compare to young healthy people getting vaccinate each year provide the good protection against flu throughout flu season its important to get a flu vaccine every season even if you get vaccinate the season before and the virus in the flu vaccine have not change for the current season can I get vaccinate and still get the flu yes its possible to get sick with flu even if you have be vaccinate although you will not know for sure unless you get a flu test this be possible for the follow reason you may be expose to a flu virus shortly before get vaccinate or during the period that it take the body to gain protection after getting vaccinate this exposure may result in you become ill with flu before the vaccine begin to protect you antibodie that provide protection develop in the body about 2 week after vaccination you may be expose to a flu virus that be not include in the seasonal flu vaccine there be many different flu virus that circulate every year a flu vaccine be make to protect against the three or four flu virus that research suggest will be most common unfortunately some people can become infect with a flu virus a flu vaccine be design to protect against despite get vaccinated protection provide by flu vaccination can vary widely base in part on health and age factor of the person getting vaccinate in general a flu vaccine work well among healthy young adult and old child some old people and people with certain chronic illness may develop less immunity after vaccination flu vaccination be not a perfect tool but it be the good way to protect against flu infection top of page flu vaccine effectiveness how effective will flu vaccine be this season influenza vaccine effectiveness ve can vary from season to season and among different age and risk group and even by vaccine type how well the vaccine work can depend in part on the match between the vaccine virus use to produce vaccine and circulate virus that season its not possible to predict in advance what flu virus will predominate cdc monitor circulate virus throughout the year and provide new and update information about their similarity to flu vaccine virus as it become available information be publish weekly in fluview and summarize at interval in the morbidity and mortality weekly report mmwr vaccine effectiveness estimate be also provide when they become available while vaccine effectiveness can vary recent study show vaccine reduce the risk of flu illness by about 40 to 60 among the overall population during season when most circulate flu virus be like the vaccine viruse similar reduction against hospitalization have be observe too more information about previous vaccine effectiveness be available will this season flu vaccine be a good match for circulate virus its not possible to predict with certainty if a flu vaccine will be a good match for circulate flu virus a flu vaccine be make to protect against the flu virus that research and surveillance indicate will likely be most common during the season however expert must pick which flu virus to include in a flu vaccine many month in advance in order for flu vaccine to be produce and deliver on time also flu virus change constantly call drift they can change from one season to the next or they can even change within the course of one flu season another factor that can impact vaccine effectiveness especially against influenza ah3n2 virus be change that can occur in vaccine virus as they be grow in egg which be the production method for most current flu vaccine because of these factor there be always the possibility of a less than optimal match between circulate flu virus and the virus in a flu vaccine over the course of flu season cdc study sample of circulate flu virus to evaluate how close a match there be between virus use to make the flu vaccine and circulate flu virus one of the way that help cdc evaluate the match between flu vaccine virus and circulate flu virus be with a lab process call genetic and antigenic characterization result of genetic and antigenic characterization testing be publish weekly in cdcs fluview can a flu vaccine provide protection even if the flu vaccine be not a good match yes antibody make in response to vaccination with one flu virus can sometimes provide protection against different but related flu virus a less than ideal match may result in reduce vaccine effectiveness against the flu virus that be different from what be in the flu vaccine but it might still provide some protection against flu illness in addition its important to remember that a flu vaccine contain three or four flu virus depend on the type of vaccine you receive so that even when there be a less than ideal match or low effectiveness against one virus a flu vaccine may protect against the other flu virus for these reason even during season when there be a less than ideal match cdc continue to recommend flu vaccination for everyone 6 month and old vaccination be particularly important for people at high risk for serious flu complication and their close contact top of page if you get sick what happen in the body when someone have flu influenza virus usually infect the respiratory tract ie the airway of the nose throat and lung as the infection progress the bodys immune system respond to fight the virus this result in inflammation that can trigger respiratory symptom such as cough and sore throat the immune system response can also trigger fever and cause muscle or body ache when infect person cough sneeze or talk they can spread influenza virus in respiratory droplet to people who be nearby people might also get flu by touch a contaminated surface or object that have flu virus on it and then touch their own mouth or nose most people who become sick will recover in a few day to less than two week but some people may become more severely ill follow flu infection moderate complication such as secondary ear and sinus infection can occur pneumonia be a serious flu complication that can result from either influenza virus infection alone or from coinfection of flu virus and bacteria other possible serious complication trigger by flu can include inflammation of the heart myocarditis brain encephalitis or muscle myositis rhabdomyolysis tissue and multiorgan failure for example respiratory and kidney failure severe complication can happen to anyone but may be more likely to happen to people who have certain chronic medical condition or in elderly person what should I do if I get sick with flu most people with flu have mild illness and do not need medical care or antiviral drug if you get sick with flu symptom in most case you should stay home and avoid contact with other people except to get medical care if however you have symptom of flu and be at high risk of flu complication or be very sick or concerned about your illness contact your health care provider there be drug your doctor may prescribe for treat flu call antiviral these drug can make you well fast and may also prevent serious complication antiviral drug be prescription drug that can be use to treat flu illness people at high risk of serious flu complication recommend for prompt antiviral treatment include child young than 2 year of age although all child young than 5 year be consider at high risk for complication from influenza the high risk be for those young than 2 year of age adult 65 year of age and old pregnant woman people with certain longterm medical condition and resident of nursing home and other longterm care facility antiviral treatment as early as possible be also recommend for people who be very sick with flu such as those with complicated progressive illness or people hospitalize because of flu other people can be treat with antiviral at their health care professional discretion treat high risk people or people who be very sick with flu with antiviral drug be very important study show that prompt treatment with antiviral drug can prevent serious flu complication prompt treatment can mean the difference between have a milder illness versus very serious illness that could result in a hospital stay treatment with antiviral work well when begin within 48 hour of get sick but can still be beneficial when give later in the course of illness antiviral drug be effective across all age and risk group study show that antiviral drug be underprescribed for people who be at high risk of complication who get flu four fdaapprove antiviral medication be recommend for use during the 20182019 flu season oseltamivir available in generic version and under the trade name tamiflu zanamivir relenza peramivir rapivab and baloxavir marboxil xofluza more information about antiviral drug can be find at treatment   antiviral drug this

sick what be baloxavir marboxil baloxavir marboxil trade name xofluza be an influenza singledose antiviral drug approve october 24 2018 by the food and drug administration fda baloxavir be approve for the treatment of acute uncomplicated flu in people 12 year and old who have have flu symptom for less than 48 hour in clinical randomize trial baloxavir be similar to oseltamivir a currently recommend flu antiviral drug in alleviate flu symptom more information regard baloxaviris available influenza antiviral drug baloxavir marboxil top of page surveillance how do cdc track flu activity the epidemiology and prevention branch in the influenza division at cdc collect compile and analyze information on flu activity year round in the united states and produce fluview a weekly influenza surveillance report and fluview interactive which allow for more indepth exploration of influenza surveillance datum the us influenza surveillance system be a collaborative effort between cdc and its many partner in state local and territorial health department public health and clinical laboratory vital statistic office healthcare provider clinic and emergency department information in five category be collect from eight different datum source that allow cdc to find out when and where influenza activity be occur track influenzarelate illness determine what influenza virus be circulate detect change in influenza virus measure the impact influenza be have on hospitalization and death in the united states for more information visit overview of influenza surveillance in the united states what will cdc do to monitor flu vaccine effectiveness for the 20182019 season cdc collaborate with partner each season to assess how well the seasonal flu vaccine be work during the 20182019 season cdc be plan multiple study on the effectiveness of flu shot these study measure vaccine effectiveness in prevent laboratoryconfirmed influenza among person 6 month of age and old a summary of cdcs late vaccine effectiveness estimate be available at seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness 20052018 what be cdc do to monitor antiviral resistance in the united states during the 20182019 season antiviral resistance mean that a virus have change in such a way that antiviral drug be less effective or not effective at all in treat or prevent illness with that virus cdc will continue to collect and monitor flu virus for change through an establish network of domestic and global surveillance system cdc also be work with the state public health department and the world health organization to collect additional information on antiviral resistance in the united states and worldwide the information collect will assist in make informed recommendation regard use of antiviral drug to treat influenza how do cdc estimate the burden of seasonal flu on the united states the burden of influenza on the united states can vary widely from season to season and be determine by a number of factor include the characteristic of circulate virus the timing of the season population immunity to circulate virus how well flu vaccine be work and how many people have get vaccinated while the impact of flu vary it place a substantial burden on the health of people in the united states each year cdc use a model to estimate the number of influenza illnesse medical visit and hospitalization in the united states as well as the impact of influenza vaccination on these number the same model be also extend to estimate flurelated death in the united states this methodology have be use to retroactively calculate influenza burden include death go back to 2010 start with the 20182019 flu season cdc will report cumulative inseason estimate of the burden of influenza these preliminary inseason burden estimate will be update weekly over the course of the flu season how do cdc classify flu season severity in 2017 cdc adopt and outline a new methodology for determine flu season severity base on datum from past flu season cdc researcher use key flu indicator datum to develop intensity threshold its to classify the severity of flu season base on the intensity threshold cdc researcher classify seasonal severity from 20032004 through the 20172018 flu season overall four season be classify as low severity seven as moderate two as high and none as very high what be flu forecast influenza flu place a significant disease burden on the us population each year but the magnitude and timing varie from season to season make the annual impact difficult to predict at the beginning of each season flu forecasting can change that by predict in advance when the start peak and increase in flu activity will occur unlike cdcs traditional influenza surveillance system which measure influenza activity after it have occur flu forecasting offer the possibility to look into the future and well plan ahead potentially reduce the impact of flu\n"

for the 20182019 season the nasal spray flu vaccine live attenuate influenza vaccine or laiv be again a recommend option for influenza vaccination of person for whom it be otherwise appropriate the nasal spray be approve for use in nonpregnant individual 2 to 49 year old there be a precaution against the use of laiv for people with certain underlying medical condition all laiv will be quadrivalent fourcomponent most regulardose eggbase flu shot will be quadrivalent all recombinant vaccine will be quadrivalent no trivalent recombinant vaccine will be available this season cellgrown flu vaccine will be quadrivalent for this vaccine the influenza ah3n2 and both influenza b reference virus will be cellderive and the influenza ah1n1 will be eggderive all these reference virus will be grow in cell to produce the component of flucelvax no intradermal flu vaccine will be available the age recommendation for fluarix quadrivalent be change from 3 year and old to 6 month and old after the annual recommendation be publish last season to be consistent with food and drug administration fdaapprove label the age recommendation for afluria quadrivalent be change from 18 year and old to 5 year and old after the annual recommendation be publish last season to be consistent with food and drug administration fdaapprove labeling baloxavir marboxil trade name xofluza be a new

provider may choose to administer any license ageappropriate flu vaccine iiv riv4 or laiv4 option this season include standard dose flu shot these be give into the muscle they be usually give with a needle but two afluria and afluria quadrivalent can be give to some people those 18 to 64 year old with a jet injector highdose shot for old people shot make with adjuvant for old people shot make with virus grow in cell culture shot make use a vaccine production technology recombinant vaccine that do not require the use of flu virus live attenuate influenza vaccine laiv   or the nasal spray vaccine   be also an option for use during the 20182019 season for person whom it be otherwise appropriate there be a table show all flu vaccine that be fdaapprove for use in the united states during the 20182019 season what viruse will the 20182019 flu vaccine protect against there be many different flu virus and they be constantly change the composition of us flu vaccine be review annually and update as need to match circulate flu virus flu vaccine protect against the three or four virus depend on vaccine that research suggest will be most common for 20182019 trivalent threecomponent vaccine be recommend to contain amichigan452015 h1n1pdm09like virus asingaporeinfimh1600192016 ah3n2like virus update bcolorado062017like victoria lineage virus update quadrivalent fourcomponent vaccine which protect against a second lineage of b virus be recommend to contain the three recommend virus above plus bphuket30732013like yamagata lineage virus when should I get vaccinate you should get a flu vaccine before flu begin spread in your community it take about two week after vaccination for antibody that protect against flu to develop in the body so make plan to get vaccinate early in fall before flu season begin cdc recommend that people get a flu vaccine by the end of october getting vaccinate later however can still be beneficial and vaccination should continue to be offer throughout flu season even into january or late child who need two dose of vaccine to be protect should start the vaccination process soon because the two dose must be give at least four week apart can I get a flu vaccine if I be allergic to egg the recommendation for people with egg allergy be the same as last season people who have experience only hive after exposure to egg can get any licensed flu vaccine that be otherwise appropriate for their age and health people who have symptom other than hive after exposure to egg such as angioedema respiratory distress lightheadedness or recurrent emesis or who have need epinephrine or another emergency medical intervention can also get any licensed flu vaccine that be otherwise appropriate for their age and health but the vaccine should be give in a medical setting and be supervise by a health care provider who be able to recognize and manage severe allergic condition setting include hospital clinic health department and physician office people with egg allergy no long have to wait 30 minute after receive their vaccine implication of cellbase vaccine why be it significant that cellgrown vaccine reference virus be use to produce some component of one type of flu vaccine cellgrown reference virus do not have the change that be present in egggrown reference virus so they should be more similar to circulate wildtype virus vaccine effectiveness depend in part on the match between the vaccine virus and circulate flu virus be flu vaccine make use a cellgrown reference virus and cellbase technology more effective than vaccine make use an egggrown reference virus and eggbase technology while the use of cellgrown reference virus and cellbase technology may offer the potential for well protection over traditional eggbase flu vaccine because they result in vaccine virus that be more similar to flu virus in circulation there be no datum yet to support this there be no preferential recommendation for one injectable flu vaccine over another top of page flu activity what sort of flu season be expect this year it be not possible to predict what this flu season will be like while flu spread every year the timing severity and length of the season vary from one season to another will new flu virus circulate this season flu virus be constantly change so its not unusual for new flu virus to appear each year more information about how flu virus change be available will the united states have a flu epidemic the united states experience annual epidemic of seasonal flu this time of year be call flu season in the united states flu virus be most common during the fall and winter month influenza activity often begin to increase in october and november most of the time flu activity peak between december and february and it can last as late as may cdc monitor certain key flu indicator for example outpatient visit of influenzalike illness ili the result of laboratory testing and report of flu hospitalization and death when these indicator rise and remain elevated for a number of consecutive week flu season be say to have begin usually ili increase first follow by an increase in fluassociate hospitalization which be then follow by increase in fluassociate death for the most current influenza surveillance information weekly us influenza surveillance report when will flu activity begin and when will it peak the timing of flu be unpredictable and can vary in different part of the country and from season to season seasonal flu virus can be detect yearround however seasonal flu activity often begin as early as october and november and can continue to occur as late as may flu activity most commonly peak in the united states between december and february how many people get sick with flu every year cdc conduct surveillance for people who see their health care provider for flulike illness through the outpatient influenzalike illness surveillance network ilinet a network of thousand of health care provider who report the proportion of patient seek care for flulike illness weekly to cdc this system allow cdc to track level of medically attend flulike illness over the course of the flu season cdc do not know exactly how many people get sick with seasonal flu each year there be several reason for this include that ilinet do not include every health care provider and monitor flulike illness not laboratoryconfirme influenza case also flu illness be not a reportable disease and not everyone who get sick with flu seek medical care or get test cdc use mathematical modeling in combination with datum from traditional flu surveillance system to estimate the number of flu illness in the united states cdc estimate that flu have result in between 93 million and 49 million illness each year in the united states since 2010 more information on these estimate be available on cdcs disease burden of influenza page during the 20182019 flu season cdc begin report cumulative inseason estimate of the disease burden of influenza include estimate of the total number of flu illness in the united states more information regard these preliminary inseason burden estimate be available for more information on cdc surveillance system see cdcs overview of influenza surveillance in the united states how many people be hospitalize from flu every year cdc conduct surveillance for flurelated hospitalization through the influenza hospitalization surveillance network flusurvnet a collaboration between cdc the emerge infection program and additional influenza hospitalization surveillance project ihsp state in 13 geographically distribute area in the united states the network include hospital that serve roughly 9 percent of the us population the datum collect through flusurvnet allow cdc to calculate an overall hospitalization rate as well as by age group but this system do not provide the total number of flu hospitalization that actually occur in the united states report flusurvnet hospitalization rate be adjust to correct for underdetection which be calculate from the percent of person hospitalize with respiratory illness who be test for influenza and the average sensitivity of influenza test use in the participate flusurvnet surveillance hospital cdc use these method to estimate the true burden of flu hospitalization in the united states since 2010 cdc estimate that flu have result in between 140000 and 960000 hospitalization each year for more information on these estimate see cdcs disease burden of influenza page during the 20182019 flu season cdc begin report cumulative inseason estimate of disease burden of influenza include estimate of the total number of people hospitalize in the united states from flu more information regard these preliminary inseason burden estimate be available for more information on cdc surveillance system see cdcs overview of influenza surveillance in the united states how many adult die from flu each year flu death in adult be not nationally notifiable in order to monitor influenza relate death in all age group cdc track pneumonia and influenza piattribute death through the national center for health statistic nch mortality reporting system this system track the proportion of death certificate process that list pneumonia or influenza as the underlying or contribute cause of death this system provide an overall indication of whether fluassociate death be elevate but do not provide an exact number of how many people die from flu as it do for the number of flu case doctor visit and hospitalization cdc also estimate death in the united states use mathematical modeling cdc estimate that from 20102011 to 20172018 influenzaassociate death in the united states range from a low of 12000 during 20112012 to a high of 79000 during 20172018 the model use to estimate fluassociate death use a ratio of deathstohospitalization in order to estimate the total flurelated death during a season for more information how cdc estimate burden as datum allow cdc will begin report cumulative inseason estimate of the influenza mortality burden more information regard these preliminary inseason burden estimate be available for more information overview of influenza surveillance in the united states mortality surveillance how many child die from flu each year influenzaassociate death in child people young than 18 become nationally reportable in 2004 since that time the number of pediatric flu death report to cdc each year have range from 37 20112012 season to 185 death 20172018 season its important to note that the actual number of flu death in child be think to be high than what be report by state to cdc because not all flu death in child be detectedreporte cdc also estimate the number of flurelated death use statistical model estimate of death in child since 2010 have range from 37 20112012 to about 1200 20122013 cdc believe these estimate number of pediatric death be likely a well estimate of the number of pediatric flu death for more information on these estimate see cdcs disease burden of influenza page why be it difficult to know exactly how many people die from flu there be several factor that make it difficult to determine accurate number of death cause by flu regardless of report some of the challenge in count flu associate death include the follow the sheer volume of death to be count the lack of testing not everyone that die with an influenzalike illness be test for influenza and the different coding of death influenzaassociate death often be a result of complication secondary to underlie medical problem and this may be difficult to sort out for more information estimate seasonal influenzaassociate death in the united states top of page protective action what should I do to protect myself from flu this season cdc recommend a yearly flu vaccine for everyone 6 month of age and old as the first and most important step in protect against this serious disease in addition to get a seasonal flu vaccine you can take everyday preventive action like stay away from sick people and wash your hand to reduce the spread of germ if you be sick with flu stay home from work or school to prevent spread flu to other in addition there be prescription medication call antiviral drug that can be use to treat influenza illness what should I do to protect my love one from flu this season encourage your love one to get vaccinated vaccination be especially important for people at high risk for develop flu complication and their close contact also if you have a love one who be at high risk of flu complication and they develop flu symptom encourage they to get a medical evaluation for possible treatment with flu antiviral drug these drug work well if give within 48 hour of when symptom start cdc recommend that people who be at high risk for serious flu complication and who get flu symptom during flu season be treat with flu antiviral drug as quickly as possible without wait for confirmatory testing people who be not at high risk for serious flu complication may also be treat with flu antiviral drug especially if treatment can begin within 48 hour do some child require two dose of flu vaccine yes some child 6 month through 8 year of age will require two dose of flu vaccine for adequate protection from flu child in this age group who be getting vaccinate for the first time will need two dose of flu vaccine space at least 4 week apart child who have only receive one dose in their lifetime also need two dose your child doctor or other health care professional can tell you if your child need two dose of flu vaccine what can I do to protect child who be too young to get vaccinated child young than 6 month old be at high risk of serious flu complication but be too young to get a flu vaccine because of this safeguard they from flu be especially important if you live with or care for an infant young than 6 month old you should get a flu vaccine to help protect they from flu advice for caregiver of young child be available for more information everyone else who be around the baby also should be vaccinate also study have show that flu vaccination of the mother during pregnancy can protect the baby after birth from flu infection for several month in addition to getting vaccinate you and your love one can take everyday preventive action like stay away from sick people and wash your hand to reduce the spread of germ if you be sick with flu stay home from work or school to prevent spread flu to other top of page vaccine and vaccination how much flu vaccine will be available this season flu vaccine be produce by private manufacturer so supply depend on manufacturer for the 20182019 season manufacturer project they would provide between 163 million and 168 million dose of injectable vaccine for the us market projection may change as the season progress flu vaccine supply update will be provide as they become available at seasonal influenza vaccine   total dose distribute be any of the available flu vaccine recommend over the other for the 20182019 flu season acip recommend annual influenza vaccination for everyone 6 month and old with any licensed ageappropriate flu vaccine iiv riv4 or laiv4 with no preference express for any one vaccine over another there be many vaccine option to choose from the most important thing be for all people 6 month and old to get a flu vaccine every year if you have question about which vaccine be good for you talk to your doctor or other health care professional why be the nasal spray be recommend as an option this year when it have be show to not be effective in past flu season while observational datum from 201011 through 201516 flu season indicate that laiv be not effective among 2 through 17yearolds against h1n1pdm09 influenza virus in the us laiv be effective against influenza b virus and be similarly effective to inactivate influenza vaccine against h3n2 virus some datum suggest that the new h1n1 vaccine virus include in the new laiv vaccine will have improve effectiveness against circulate h1n1 virus however no publish effectiveness estimate be available yet when should I get vaccinated getting vaccinate before flu activity begin help protect you once flu season start in your community it take about two week after vaccination for the bodys immune response to fully respond and for you to be protect so make plan to get vaccinate cdc recommend that people get a flu vaccine by the end of october however getting vaccinate later can still be beneficial cdc recommend ongoing flu vaccination as long as influenza virus be circulate even into january or late child 6 month to 8 year old who need two dose of vaccine should get the first dose as soon after vaccine be available to allow time to get the second dose before the start of flu season the two dose should be give at least 4 week apart where can I get a flu vaccine flu vaccine be offer by many doctor office clinic health department pharmacy and college health center as well as by many employer and even by some school even if you do not have a regular doctor or nurse you can get a flu vaccine somewhere else like a health department pharmacy urgent care clinic and often your school college health center or work the healthmap vaccine finder help you to locate where you can get a flu vaccine what be flu vaccination use a jet injector the us food and drug administration fda have approve two influenza vaccine afluria and afluria quadrivalent for administration by a jet injector device the pharmajet stratis 05ml needlefree jet injector for people 18 through 64 year of age these be the only two influenza vaccine approve for administration by jet injector people age 18 through 64 year may receive these vaccine either by jet injector or needle a jet injector be a medical device use for vaccination that use a highpressure narrow stream of fluid to penetrate the skin instead of a hypodermic needle more information about flu vaccination by jet injector be available what be adjuvante flu vaccine the us food and drug administration fda license a seasonal influenza flu vaccine contain adjuvant for adult 65 year of age and old an adjuvant be an ingredient add to a vaccine to create a strong immune response to vaccination fluad be license in november 2015 and will be available during the 20182019 flu season it contain the mf59 adjuvant an oilinwater emulsion of squalene oil fluad be the first adjuvante seasonal flu vaccine market in the united states how long do a flu vaccine protect I from get flu multiple study conduct over different season and across flu vaccine type and influenza virus subtype have show that the bodys immunity to influenza virus acquire either through natural infection or vaccination decline over time the decline in antibody be influence by several factor include the antigen use in the vaccine the age of the person be vaccinate and the person general health for example certain chronic health condition may have an impact on immunity old people and other with weaken immune system may not generate the same amount of antibody after vaccination far their antibody level may drop more quickly when compare to young healthy people getting vaccinate each year provide the good protection against flu throughout flu season its important to get a flu vaccine every season even if you get vaccinate the season before and the virus in the flu vaccine have not change for the current season can I get vaccinate and still get the flu yes its possible to get sick with flu even if you have be vaccinate although you will not know for sure unless you get a flu test this be possible for the follow reason you may be expose to a flu virus shortly before get vaccinate or during the period that it take the body to gain protection after getting vaccinate this exposure may result in you become ill with flu before the vaccine begin to protect you antibodie that provide protection develop in the body about 2 week after vaccination you may be expose to a flu virus that be not include in the seasonal flu vaccine there be many different flu virus that circulate every year a flu vaccine be make to protect against the three or four flu virus that research suggest will be most common unfortunately some people can become infect with a flu virus a flu vaccine be design to protect against despite get vaccinated protection provide by flu vaccination can vary widely base in part on health and age factor of the person getting vaccinate in general a flu vaccine work well among healthy young adult and old child some old people and people with certain chronic illness may develop less immunity after vaccination flu vaccination be not a perfect tool but it be the good way to protect against flu infection top of page flu vaccine effectiveness how effective will flu vaccine be this season influenza vaccine effectiveness ve can vary from season to season and among different age and risk group and even by vaccine type how well the vaccine work can depend in part on the match between the vaccine virus use to produce vaccine and circulate virus that season its not possible to predict in advance what flu virus will predominate cdc monitor circulate virus throughout the year and provide new and update information about their similarity to flu vaccine virus as it become available information be publish weekly in fluview and summarize at interval in the morbidity and mortality weekly report mmwr vaccine effectiveness estimate be also provide when they become available while vaccine effectiveness can vary recent study show vaccine reduce the risk of flu illness by about 40 to 60 among the overall population during season when most circulate flu virus be like the vaccine viruse similar reduction against hospitalization have be observe too more information about previous vaccine effectiveness be available will this season flu vaccine be a good match for circulate virus its not possible to predict with certainty if a flu vaccine will be a good match for circulate flu virus a flu vaccine be make to protect against the flu virus that research and surveillance indicate will likely be most common during the season however expert must pick which flu virus to include in a flu vaccine many month in advance in order for flu vaccine to be produce and deliver on time also flu virus change constantly call drift they can change from one season to the next or they can even change within the course of one flu season another factor that can impact vaccine effectiveness especially against influenza ah3n2 virus be change that can occur in vaccine virus as they be grow in egg which be the production method for most current flu vaccine because of these factor there be always the possibility of a less than optimal match between circulate flu virus and the virus in a flu vaccine over the course of flu season cdc study sample of circulate flu virus to evaluate how close a match there be between virus use to make the flu vaccine and circulate flu virus one of the way that help cdc evaluate the match between flu vaccine virus and circulate flu virus be with a lab process call genetic and antigenic characterization result of genetic and antigenic characterization testing be publish weekly in cdcs fluview can a flu vaccine provide protection even if the flu vaccine be not a good match yes antibody make in response to vaccination with one flu virus can sometimes provide protection against different but related flu virus a less than ideal match may result in reduce vaccine effectiveness against the flu virus that be different from what be in the flu vaccine but it might still provide some protection against flu illness in addition its important to remember that a flu vaccine contain three or four flu virus depend on the type of vaccine you receive so that even when there be a less than ideal match or low effectiveness against one virus a flu vaccine may protect against the other flu virus for these reason even during season when there be a less than ideal match cdc continue to recommend flu vaccination for everyone 6 month and old vaccination be particularly important for people at high risk for serious flu complication and their close contact top of page if you get sick what happen in the body when someone have flu influenza virus usually infect the respiratory tract ie the airway of the nose throat and lung as the infection progress the bodys immune system respond to fight the virus this result in inflammation that can trigger respiratory symptom such as cough and sore throat the immune system response can also trigger fever and cause muscle or body ache when infect person cough sneeze or talk they can spread influenza virus in respiratory droplet to people who be nearby people might also get flu by touch a contaminated surface or object that have flu virus on it and then touch their own mouth or nose most people who become sick will recover in a few day to less than two week but some people may become more severely ill follow flu infection moderate complication such as secondary ear and sinus infection can occur pneumonia be a serious flu complication that can result from either influenza virus infection alone or from coinfection of flu virus and bacteria other possible serious complication trigger by flu can include inflammation of the heart myocarditis brain encephalitis or muscle myositis rhabdomyolysis tissue and multiorgan failure for example respiratory and kidney failure severe complication can happen to anyone but may be more likely to happen to people who have certain chronic medical condition or in elderly person what should I do if I get sick with flu most people with flu have mild illness and do not need medical care or antiviral drug if you get sick with flu symptom in most case you should stay home and avoid contact with other people except to get medical care if however you have symptom of flu and be at high risk of flu complication or be very sick or concerned about your illness contact your health care provider there be drug your doctor may prescribe for treat flu call antiviral these drug can make you well fast and may also prevent serious complication antiviral drug be prescription drug that can be use to treat flu illness people at high risk of serious flu complication recommend for prompt antiviral treatment include child young than 2 year of age although all child young than 5 year be consider at high risk for complication from influenza the high risk be for those young than 2 year of age adult 65 year of age and old pregnant woman people with certain longterm medical condition and resident of nursing home and other longterm care facility antiviral treatment as early as possible be also recommend for people who be very sick with flu such as those with complicated progressive illness or people hospitalize because of flu other people can be treat with antiviral at their health care professional discretion treat high risk people or people who be very sick with flu with antiviral drug be very important study show that prompt treatment with antiviral drug can prevent serious flu complication prompt treatment can mean the difference between have a milder illness versus very serious illness that could result in a hospital stay treatment with antiviral work well when begin within 48 hour of get sick but can still be beneficial when give later in the course of illness antiviral drug be effective across all age and risk group study show that antiviral drug be underprescribed for people who be at high risk of complication who get flu four fdaapprove antiviral medication be recommend for use during the 20182019 flu season oseltamivir available in generic version and under the trade name tamiflu zanamivir relenza peramivir rapivab and baloxavir marboxil xofluza more information about antiviral drug can be find at treatment   antiviral drug this guidance be consistent with the 20182019 flu season recommendation publish by the infectious disease society of america idsa on december 19 in clinical infectious disease the flu what to do if you get sick what be baloxavir marboxil baloxavir marboxil trade name xofluza be an influenza singledose antiviral drug approve october 24 2018 by the food and drug administration fda baloxavir be approve for the treatment of acute uncomplicated flu in people 12 year and old who have have flu symptom for less than 48 hour in clinical randomize trial baloxavir be similar to oseltamivir a currently recommend flu antiviral drug in alleviate flu symptom more information regard baloxaviris available influenza antiviral drug baloxavir marboxil top of page surveillance how do cdc track flu activity the epidemiology and prevention branch in the influenza division at cdc collect compile and analyze information on flu activity year round in the united states and produce fluview a weekly influenza surveillance report and fluview interactive which allow for more indepth exploration of influenza surveillance datum the us influenza surveillance system be a collaborative effort between cdc and its many partner in state local and territorial health department public health and clinical laboratory vital statistic office healthcare provider clinic and emergency department information in five category be collect from eight different datum source that allow cdc to find out when and where influenza activity be occur track influenzarelate illness determine what influenza virus be circulate detect change in influenza virus measure the impact influenza be have on hospitalization and death in the united states for more information visit overview of influenza surveillance in the united states what will cdc do to monitor flu vaccine effectiveness for the 20182019 season cdc collaborate with partner each season to assess how well the seasonal flu vaccine be work during the 20182019 season cdc be plan multiple study on the effectiveness of flu shot these study measure vaccine effectiveness in prevent laboratoryconfirmed influenza among person 6 month of age and old a summary of cdcs late vaccine effectiveness estimate be available at seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness 20052018 what be cdc do to monitor antiviral resistance in the united states during the 20182019 season antiviral resistance mean that a virus have change in such a way that antiviral drug be less effective or not effective at all in treat or prevent illness with that virus cdc will continue to collect and monitor flu virus for change through an establish network of domestic and global surveillance system cdc also be work with the state public health department and the world health organization to collect additional information on antiviral resistance in the united states and worldwide the information collect will assist in make informed recommendation regard use of antiviral drug to treat influenza how do cdc estimate the burden of seasonal flu on the united states the burden of influenza on the united states can vary widely from season to season and be determine by a number of factor include the characteristic of circulate virus the timing of the season population immunity to circulate virus how well flu vaccine be work and how many people have get vaccinated while the impact of flu vary it place a substantial burden on the health of people in the united states each year cdc use a model to estimate the number of influenza illnesse medical visit and hospitalization in the united states as well as the impact of influenza vaccination on these number the same model be also extend to estimate flurelated death in the united states this methodology have be use to retroactively calculate influenza burden include death go back to 2010 start with the 20182019 flu season cdc will report cumulative inseason estimate of the burden of influenza these preliminary inseason burden estimate will be update weekly over the course of the flu season how do cdc classify flu season severity in 2017 cdc adopt and outline a new methodology for determine flu season severity base on datum from past flu season cdc researcher use key flu indicator datum to develop intensity threshold its to classify the severity of flu season base on the intensity threshold cdc researcher classify seasonal severity from 20032004 through the 20172018 flu season overall four season be classify as low severity seven as moderate two as high and none as very high what be flu forecast influenza flu place a significant disease burden on the us population each year but the magnitude and timing varie from season to season make the annual impact difficult to predict at the beginning of each season flu forecasting can change that by predict in advance when the start peak and increase in flu activity will occur unlike cdcs traditional influenza surveillance system which measure influenza activity after it have occur flu forecasting offer the possibility to look into the future and well plan ahead potentially reduce the impact of flu\n",

      "whats new this flu season a few things are new this season flu vaccines have been updated to better match circulating viruses the bvictoria component was changed and the influenza ah3n2 component was updated for the 20182019 season the nasal spray flu vaccine live attenuated influenza vaccine or laiv is again a recommended option for influenza vaccination of persons for whom it is otherwise appropriate the nasal spray is approved for use in nonpregnant individuals 2 to 49 years old there is a precaution against the use of laiv for people with certain underlying medical conditions all laiv will be quadrivalent fourcomponent most regulardose eggbased flu shots will be quadrivalent all recombinant vaccine will be quadrivalent no trivalent recombinant vaccine will be available this season cellgrown flu vaccine will be quadrivalent for this vaccine the influenza ah3n2 and both influenza b reference viruses will be cellderived and the influenza ah1n1 will be eggderived all these reference viruses will be grown in cells to produce the components of flucelvax no intradermal flu vaccine will be available the age recommendation for fluarix quadrivalent was changed from 3 years and older to 6 months and older after the annual recommendations were published last season to be consistent with food and drug administration fdaapproved labeling the age recommendation for afluria quadrivalent was changed from 18 years and older to 5 years and older after the annual recommendations were published last season to be consistent with food and drug administration fdaapproved labeling baloxavir marboxil trade name xofluza is a new influenza singledose antiviral drug approved october 24 2018 by the food and drug administration fda baloxavir is approved for the treatment of acute uncomplicated flu in people 12 years and older who have had flu symptoms for less than 48 hours more information is available influenza antiviral drug baloxavir marboxil cdc is reporting inseason estimates of the cumulative number of flu illnesses medical visits and hospitalizations in the us these preliminary inseason burden estimates will be updated weekly over the course of the flu season what flu vaccines are recommended this season for the 20182019 flu season providers may choose to administer any licensed ageappropriate flu vaccine iiv riv4 or laiv4 options this season include standard dose flu shots these are given into the muscle they are usually given with a needle but two afluria and afluria quadrivalent can be given to some people those 18 to 64 years old with a jet injector highdose shots for older people shots made with adjuvant for older people shots made with virus grown in cell culture shots made using a vaccine production technology recombinant vaccine that does not require the use of flu virus live attenuated influenza vaccine laiv  or the nasal spray vaccine  is also an option for use during the 20182019 season for persons whom it is otherwise appropriate there is a table showing all flu vaccines that are fdaapproved for use in the united states during the 20182019 season what viruses will the 20182019 flu vaccines protect against there are many different flu viruses and they are constantly changing the composition of us flu vaccines is reviewed annually and updated as needed to match circulating flu viruses flu vaccines protect against the three or four viruses depending on vaccine that research suggests will be most common for 20182019 trivalent threecomponent vaccines are recommended to contain amichigan452015 h1n1pdm09like virus asingaporeinfimh1600192016 ah3n2like virus updated bcolorado062017like victoria lineage virus updated quadrivalent fourcomponent vaccines which protect against a second lineage of b viruses are recommended to contain the three recommended viruses above plus bphuket30732013like yamagata lineage virus when should i get vaccinated you should get a flu vaccine before flu begins spreading in your community it takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies that protect against flu to develop in the body so make plans to get vaccinated early in fall before flu season begins cdc recommends that people get a flu vaccine by the end of october getting vaccinated later however can still be beneficial and vaccination should continue to be offered throughout flu season even into january or later children who need two doses of vaccine to be protected should start the vaccination process sooner because the two doses must be given at least four weeks apart can i get a flu vaccine if i am allergic to eggs the recommendations for people with egg allergies are the same as last season people who have experienced only hives after exposure to egg can get any licensed flu vaccine that is otherwise appropriate for their age and health people who have symptoms other than hives after exposure to eggs such as angioedema respiratory distress lightheadedness or recurrent emesis or who have needed epinephrine or another emergency medical intervention can also get any licensed flu vaccine that is otherwise appropriate for their age and health but the vaccine should be given in a medical setting and be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic conditions settings include hospitals clinics health departments and physician offices people with egg allergies no longer have to wait 30 minutes after receiving their vaccine implications of cellbased vaccines why is it significant that cellgrown vaccine reference viruses are used to produce some components of one type of flu vaccine cellgrown reference viruses do not have the changes that are present in egggrown reference viruses so they should be more similar to circulating wildtype viruses vaccine effectiveness depends in part on the match between the vaccine virus and circulating flu viruses is flu vaccine made using a cellgrown reference virus and cellbased technology more effective than vaccine made using an egggrown reference virus and eggbased technology while the use of cellgrown reference viruses and cellbased technology may offer the potential for better protection over traditional eggbased flu vaccines because they result in vaccine viruses that are more similar to flu viruses in circulation there are no data yet to support this there is no preferential recommendation for one injectable flu vaccine over another top of page flu activity what sort of flu season is expected this year it is not possible to predict what this flu season will be like while flu spreads every year the timing severity and length of the season varies from one season to another will new flu viruses circulate this season flu viruses are constantly changing so its not unusual for new flu viruses to appear each year more information about how flu viruses change is available will the united states have a flu epidemic the united states experiences annual epidemics of seasonal flu this time of year is called flu season in the united states flu viruses are most common during the fall and winter months influenza activity often begins to increase in october and november most of the time flu activity peaks between december and february and it can last as late as may cdc monitors certain key flu indicators for example outpatient visits of influenzalike illness ili the results of laboratory testing and reports of flu hospitalizations and deaths when these indicators rise and remain elevated for a number of consecutive weeks flu season is said to have begun usually ili increases first followed by an increase in fluassociated hospitalizations which is then followed by increases in fluassociated deaths for the most current influenza surveillance information weekly us influenza surveillance report when will flu activity begin and when will it peak the timing of flu is unpredictable and can vary in different parts of the country and from season to season seasonal flu viruses can be detected yearround however seasonal flu activity often begins as early as october and november and can continue to occur as late as may flu activity most commonly peaks in the united states between december and february how many people get sick with flu every year cdc conducts surveillance for people who see their health care provider for flulike illness through the outpatient influenzalike illness surveillance network ilinet a network of thousands of health care providers who report the proportion of patients seeking care for flulike illness weekly to cdc this system allows cdc to track levels of medically attended flulike illness over the course of the flu season cdc does not know exactly how many people get sick with seasonal flu each year there are several reasons for this including that ilinet does not include every health care provider and monitors flulike illness not laboratoryconfirmed influenza cases also flu illness is not a reportable disease and not everyone who gets sick with flu seeks medical care or gets tested cdc uses mathematical modeling in combination with data from traditional flu surveillance systems to estimate the numbers of flu illnesses in the united states cdc estimates that flu has resulted in between 93 million and 49 million illnesses each year in the united states since 2010 more information on these estimates is available on cdcs disease burden of influenza page during the 20182019 flu season cdc began reporting cumulative inseason estimates of the disease burden of influenza including estimates of the total number of flu illnesses in the united states more information regarding these preliminary inseason burden estimates is available for more information on cdc surveillance systems see cdcs overview of influenza surveillance in the united states how many people are hospitalized from flu every year cdc conducts surveillance for flurelated hospitalizations through the influenza hospitalization surveillance network flusurvnet a collaboration between cdc the emerging infections program and additional influenza hospitalization surveillance project ihsp states in 13 geographically distributed areas in the united states the network includes hospitals that serve roughly 9 percent of the us population the data collected through flusurvnet allows cdc to calculate an overall hospitalization rate as well as by age group but this system does not provide the total number of flu hospitalizations that actually occur in the united states reported flusurvnet hospitalization rates are adjusted to correct for underdetection which is calculated from the percent of persons hospitalized with respiratory illness who were tested for influenza and the average sensitivity of influenza tests used in the participating flusurvnet surveillance hospitals cdc uses these methods to estimate the true burden of flu hospitalizations in the united states since 2010 cdc estimates that flu has resulted in between 140000 and 960000 hospitalizations each year for more information on these estimates see cdcs disease burden of influenza page during the 20182019 flu season cdc began reporting cumulative inseason estimates of disease burden of influenza including estimates of the total number of people hospitalized in the united states from flu more information regarding these preliminary inseason burden estimates is available for more information on cdc surveillance systems see cdcs overview of influenza surveillance in the united states how many adults die from flu each year flu deaths in adults are not nationally notifiable in order to monitor influenza related deaths in all age groups cdc tracks pneumonia and influenza piattributed deaths through the national center for health statistics nchs mortality reporting system this system tracks the proportion of death certificates processed that list pneumonia or influenza as the underlying or contributing cause of death this system provides an overall indication of whether fluassociated deaths are elevated but does not provide an exact number of how many people died from flu as it does for the numbers of flu cases doctors visits and hospitalizations cdc also estimates deaths in the united states using mathematical modeling cdc estimates that from 20102011 to 20172018 influenzaassociated deaths in the united states ranged from a low of 12000 during 20112012 to a high of 79000 during 20172018 the model used to estimate fluassociated deaths uses a ratio of deathstohospitalizations in order to estimate the total flurelated deaths during a season for more information how cdc estimates burden as data allow cdc will begin reporting cumulative inseason estimates of the influenza mortality burden more information regarding these preliminary inseason burden estimates is available for more information overview of influenza surveillance in the united states mortality surveillance how many children die from flu each year influenzaassociated deaths in children people younger than 18 became nationally reportable in 2004 since that time the number of pediatric flu deaths reported to cdc each year has ranged from 37 20112012 season to 185 deaths 20172018 season its important to note that the actual number of flu deaths in children is thought to be higher than what is reported by states to cdc because not all flu deaths in children are detectedreported cdc also estimates the numbers of flurelated deaths using statistical models estimates of deaths in children since 2010 have ranged from 37 20112012 to about 1200 20122013 cdc believes these estimated numbers of pediatric deaths are likely a better estimate of the number of pediatric flu deaths for more information on these estimates see cdcs disease burden of influenza page why is it difficult to know exactly how many people die from flu there are several factors that make it difficult to determine accurate numbers of deaths caused by flu regardless of reporting some of the challenges in counting flu associated deaths include the following the sheer volume of deaths to be counted the lack of testing not everyone that dies with an influenzalike illness is tested for influenza and the different coding of deaths influenzaassociated deaths often are a result of complications secondary to underlying medical problems and this may be difficult to sort out for more information estimating seasonal influenzaassociated deaths in the united states top of page protective actions what should i do to protect myself from flu this season cdc recommends a yearly flu vaccine for everyone 6 months of age and older as the first and most important step in protecting against this serious disease in addition to getting a seasonal flu vaccine you can take everyday preventive actions like staying away from sick people and washing your hands to reduce the spread of germs if you are sick with flu stay home from work or school to prevent spreading flu to others in addition there are prescription medications called antiviral drugs that can be used to treat influenza illness what should i do to protect my loved ones from flu this season encourage your loved ones to get vaccinated vaccination is especially important for people at high risk for developing flu complications and their close contacts also if you have a loved one who is at high risk of flu complications and they develop flu symptoms encourage them to get a medical evaluation for possible treatment with flu antiviral drugs these drugs work best if given within 48 hours of when symptoms start cdc recommends that people who are at high risk for serious flu complications and who get flu symptoms during flu season be treated with flu antiviral drugs as quickly as possible without waiting for confirmatory testing people who are not at high risk for serious flu complications may also be treated with flu antiviral drugs especially if treatment can begin within 48 hours do some children require two doses of flu vaccine yes some children 6 months through 8 years of age will require two doses of flu vaccine for adequate protection from flu children in this age group who are getting vaccinated for the first time will need two doses of flu vaccine spaced at least 4 weeks apart children who have only received one dose in their lifetime also need two doses your childs doctor or other health care professional can tell you if your child needs two doses of flu vaccine what can i do to protect children who are too young to get vaccinated children younger than 6 months old are at high risk of serious flu complications but are too young to get a flu vaccine because of this safeguarding them from flu is especially important if you live with or care for an infant younger than 6 months old you should get a flu vaccine to help protect them from flu advice for caregivers of young children is available for more information everyone else who is around the baby also should be vaccinated also studies have shown that flu vaccination of the mother during pregnancy can protect the baby after birth from flu infection for several months in addition to getting vaccinated you and your loved ones can take everyday preventive actions like staying away from sick people and washing your hands to reduce the spread of germs if you are sick with flu stay home from work or school to prevent spreading flu to others top of page vaccine and vaccination how much flu vaccine will be available this season flu vaccine is produced by private manufacturers so supply depends on manufacturers for the 20182019 season manufacturers projected they would provide between 163 million and 168 million doses of injectable vaccine for the us market projections may change as the season progresses flu vaccine supply updates will be provided as they become available at seasonal influenza vaccine  total doses distributed are any of the available flu vaccines recommended over the others for the 20182019 flu season acip recommends annual influenza vaccination for everyone 6 months and older with any licensed ageappropriate flu vaccine iiv riv4 or laiv4 with no preference expressed for any one vaccine over another there are many vaccine options to choose from the most important thing is for all people 6 months and older to get a flu vaccine every year if you have questions about which vaccine is best for you talk to your doctor or other health care professional why is the nasal spray being recommended as an option this year when it has been shown to not be effective in past flu seasons while observational data from 201011 through 201516 flu seasons indicate that laiv was not effective among 2 through 17yearolds against h1n1pdm09 influenza viruses in the us laiv was effective against influenza b viruses and was similarly effective to inactivated influenza vaccines against h3n2 viruses some data suggest that the new h1n1 vaccine virus included in the new laiv vaccines will have improved effectiveness against circulating h1n1 viruses however no published effectiveness estimates are available yet when should i get vaccinated getting vaccinated before flu activity begins helps protect you once flu season starts in your community it takes about two weeks after vaccination for the bodys immune response to fully respond and for you to be protected so make plans to get vaccinated cdc recommends that people get a flu vaccine by the end of october however getting vaccinated later can still be beneficial cdc recommends ongoing flu vaccination as long as influenza viruses are circulating even into january or later children 6 months to 8 years old who need two doses of vaccine should get the first dose as soon after vaccine is available to allow time to get the second dose before the start of flu season the two doses should be given at least 4 weeks apart where can i get a flu vaccine flu vaccines are offered by many doctors offices clinics health departments pharmacies and college health centers as well as by many employers and even by some schools even if you dont have a regular doctor or nurse you can get a flu vaccine somewhere else like a health department pharmacy urgent care clinic and often your school college health center or work the healthmap vaccine finder helps you to locate where you can get a flu vaccine what is flu vaccination using a jet injector the us food and drug administration fda has approved two influenza vaccines afluria and afluria quadrivalent for administration by a jet injector device the pharmajet stratis 05ml needlefree jet injector for people 18 through 64 years of age these are the only two influenza vaccines approved for administration by jet injector people aged 18 through 64 years may receive these vaccines either by jet injector or needle a jet injector is a medical device used for vaccination that uses a highpressure narrow stream of fluid to penetrate the skin instead of a hypodermic needle more information about flu vaccination by jet injector is available what is adjuvanted flu vaccine the us food and drug administration fda licensed a seasonal influenza flu vaccine containing adjuvant for adults 65 years of age and older an adjuvant is an ingredient added to a vaccine to create a stronger immune response to vaccination fluad was licensed in november 2015 and will be available during the 20182019 flu season it contains the mf59 adjuvant an oilinwater emulsion of squalene oil fluad is the first adjuvanted seasonal flu vaccine marketed in the united states how long does a flu vaccine protect me from getting flu multiple studies conducted over different seasons and across flu vaccine types and influenza virus subtypes have shown that the bodys immunity to influenza viruses acquired either through natural infection or vaccination declines over time the decline in antibodies is influenced by several factors including the antigen used in the vaccine the age of the person being vaccinated and the persons general health for example certain chronic health conditions may have an impact on immunity older people and others with weakened immune systems may not generate the same amount of antibodies after vaccination further their antibody levels may drop more quickly when compared to young healthy people getting vaccinated each year provides the best protection against flu throughout flu season its important to get a flu vaccine every season even if you got vaccinated the season before and the viruses in the flu vaccine have not changed for the current season can i get vaccinated and still get the flu yes its possible to get sick with flu even if you have been vaccinated although you wont know for sure unless you get a flu test this is possible for the following reasons you may be exposed to a flu virus shortly before getting vaccinated or during the period that it takes the body to gain protection after getting vaccinated this exposure may result in you becoming ill with flu before the vaccine begins to protect you antibodies that provide protection develop in the body about 2 weeks after vaccination you may be exposed to a flu virus that is not included in the seasonal flu vaccine there are many different flu viruses that circulate every year a flu vaccine is made to protect against the three or four flu viruses that research suggests will be most common unfortunately some people can become infected with a flu virus a flu vaccine is designed to protect against despite getting vaccinated protection provided by flu vaccination can vary widely based in part on health and age factors of the person getting vaccinated in general a flu vaccine works best among healthy younger adults and older children some older people and people with certain chronic illnesses may develop less immunity after vaccination flu vaccination is not a perfect tool but it is the best way to protect against flu infection top of page flu vaccine effectiveness how effective will flu vaccines be this season influenza vaccine effectiveness ve can vary from season to season and among different age and risk groups and even by vaccine type how well the vaccine works can depend in part on the match between the vaccine viruses used to produce vaccine and circulating viruses that season its not possible to predict in advance what flu viruses will predominate cdc monitors circulating viruses throughout the year and provides new and updated information about their similarity to flu vaccine viruses as it becomes available information is published weekly in fluview and summarized at intervals in the morbidity and mortality weekly report mmwr vaccine effectiveness estimates are also provided when they become available while vaccine effectiveness can vary recent studies show vaccine reduces the risk of flu illness by about 40 to 60 among the overall population during seasons when most circulating flu viruses are like the vaccine viruses similar reductions against hospitalization have been observed too more information about previous vaccine effectiveness is available will this seasons flu vaccine be a good match for circulating viruses its not possible to predict with certainty if a flu vaccine will be a good match for circulating flu viruses a flu vaccine is made to protect against the flu viruses that research and surveillance indicate will likely be most common during the season however experts must pick which flu viruses to include in a flu vaccine many months in advance in order for flu vaccines to be produced and delivered on time also flu viruses change constantly called drift they can change from one season to the next or they can even change within the course of one flu season another factor that can impact vaccine effectiveness especially against influenza ah3n2 viruses are changes that can occur in vaccine viruses as they are grown in eggs which is the production method for most current flu vaccines because of these factors there is always the possibility of a less than optimal match between circulating flu viruses and the viruses in a flu vaccine over the course of flu season cdc studies samples of circulating flu viruses to evaluate how close a match there is between viruses used to make the flu vaccine and circulating flu viruses one of the ways that helps cdc evaluate the match between flu vaccine viruses and circulating flu viruses is with a lab process called genetic and antigenic characterization results of genetic and antigenic characterization testing are published weekly in cdcs fluview can a flu vaccine provide protection even if the flu vaccine is not a good match yes antibodies made in response to vaccination with one flu virus can sometimes provide protection against different but related flu viruses a less than ideal match may result in reduced vaccine effectiveness against the flu virus that is different from what is in the flu vaccine but it might still provide some protection against flu illness in addition its important to remember that a flu vaccine contains three or four flu viruses depending on the type of vaccine you receive so that even when there is a less than ideal match or lower effectiveness against one virus a flu vaccine may protect against the other flu viruses for these reasons even during seasons when there is a less than ideal match cdc continues to recommend flu vaccination for everyone 6 months and older vaccination is particularly important for people at high risk for serious flu complications and their close contacts top of page if you get sick what happens in the body when someone has flu influenza viruses usually infect the respiratory tract ie the airways of the nose throat and lungs as the infection progresses the bodys immune system responds to fight the virus this results in inflammation that can trigger respiratory symptoms such as cough and sore throat the immune system response can also trigger fever and cause muscle or body aches when infected persons cough sneeze or talk they can spread influenza viruses in respiratory droplets to people who are nearby people might also get flu by touching a contaminated surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth or nose most people who become sick will recover in a few days to less than two weeks but some people may become more severely ill following flu infection moderate complications such as secondary ear and sinus infections can occur pneumonia is a serious flu complication that can result from either influenza virus infection alone or from coinfection of flu virus and bacteria other possible serious complications triggered by flu can include inflammation of the heart myocarditis brain encephalitis or muscle myositis rhabdomyolysis tissues and multiorgan failure for example respiratory and kidney failure severe complications can happen to anyone but may be more likely to happen to people who have certain chronic medical conditions or in elderly persons what should i do if i get sick with flu most people with flu have mild illness and do not need medical care or antiviral drugs if you get sick with flu symptoms in most cases you should stay home and avoid contact with other people except to get medical care if however you have symptoms of flu and are at high risk of flu complications or are very sick or concerned about your illness contact your health care provider there are drugs your doctor may prescribe for treating flu called antivirals these drugs can make you better faster and may also prevent serious complications antiviral drugs are prescription drugs that can be used to treat flu illness people at high risk of serious flu complications recommended for prompt antiviral treatment include children younger than 2 years of age although all children younger than 5 years are considered at higher risk for complications from influenza the highest risk is for those younger than 2 years of age adults 65 years of age and older pregnant women people with certain longterm medical conditions and residents of nursing homes and other longterm care facilities antiviral treatment as early as possible is also recommended for people who are very sick with flu such as those with complicated progressive illness or people hospitalized because of flu other people can be treated with antivirals at their health care professionals discretion treating high risk people or people who are very sick with flu with antiviral drugs is very important studies show that prompt treatment with antiviral drugs can prevent serious flu complications prompt treatment can mean the difference between having a milder illness versus very serious illness that could result in a hospital stay treatment with antivirals works best when begun within 48 hours of getting sick but can still be beneficial when given later in the course of illness antiviral drugs are effective across all age and risk groups studies show that antiviral drugs are underprescribed for people who are at high risk of complications who get flu four fdaapproved antiviral medications are recommended for use during the 20182019 flu season oseltamivir available in generic versions and under the trade name tamiflu zanamivir relenza peramivir rapivab and baloxavir marboxil xofluza more information about antiviral drugs can be found at treatment  antiviral drugs this guidance is consistent with the 20182019 flu season recommendations published by the infectious diseases society of america idsa on december 19 in clinical infectious diseases the flu what to do if you get sick what is baloxavir marboxil baloxavir marboxil trade name xofluza is an influenza singledose antiviral drug approved october 24 2018 by the food and drug administration fda baloxavir is approved for the treatment of acute uncomplicated flu in people 12 years and older who have had flu symptoms for less than 48 hours in clinical randomized trials baloxavir was similar to oseltamivir a currently recommended flu antiviral drug in alleviating flu symptoms more information regarding baloxaviris available influenza antiviral drug baloxavir marboxil top of page surveillance how does cdc track flu activity the epidemiology and prevention branch in the influenza division at cdc collects compiles and analyzes information on flu activity year round in the united states and produces fluview a weekly influenza surveillance report and fluview interactive which allows for more indepth exploration of influenza surveillance data the us influenza surveillance system is a collaborative effort between cdc and its many partners in state local and territorial health departments public health and clinical laboratories vital statistics offices healthcare providers clinics and emergency departments information in five categories is collected from eight different data sources that allow cdc to find out when and where influenza activity is occurring track influenzarelated illness determine what influenza viruses are circulating detect changes in influenza viruses measure the impact influenza is having on hospitalizations and deaths in the united states for more information visit overview of influenza surveillance in the united states what will cdc do to monitor flu vaccine effectiveness for the 20182019 season cdc collaborates with partners each season to assess how well the seasonal flu vaccines are working during the 20182019 season cdc is planning multiple studies on the effectiveness of flu shots these studies measure vaccine effectiveness in preventing laboratoryconfirmed influenza among persons 6 months of age and older a summary of cdcs latest vaccine effectiveness estimates is available at seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness 20052018 what is cdc doing to monitor antiviral resistance in the united states during the 20182019 season antiviral resistance means that a virus has changed in such a way that antiviral drugs are less effective or not effective at all in treating or preventing illnesses with that virus cdc will continue to collect and monitor flu viruses for changes through an established network of domestic and global surveillance systems cdc also is working with the state public health departments and the world health organization to collect additional information on antiviral resistance in the united states and worldwide the information collected will assist in making informed recommendations regarding use of antiviral drugs to treat influenza how does cdc estimate the burden of seasonal flu on the united states the burden of influenza on the united states can vary widely from season to season and is determined by a number of factors including the characteristics of circulating viruses the timing of the season population immunity to circulating viruses how well flu vaccines are working and how many people have gotten vaccinated while the impact of flu varies it places a substantial burden on the health of people in the united states each year cdc uses a model to estimate the numbers of influenza illnesses medical visits and hospitalizations in the united states as well as the impact of influenza vaccination on these numbers the same model is also extended to estimate flurelated deaths in the united states this methodology has been used to retroactively calculate influenza burden including deaths going back to 2010 starting with the 20182019 flu season cdc will report cumulative inseason estimates of the burden of influenza these preliminary inseason burden estimates will be updated weekly over the course of the flu season how does cdc classify flu season severity in 2017 cdc adopted and outlined a new methodology for determining flu season severity based on data from past flu seasons cdc researchers used key flu indicator data to develop intensity thresholds its to classify the severity of flu seasons based on the intensity thresholds cdc researchers classified seasonal severity from 20032004 through the 20172018 flu seasons overall four seasons were classified as low severity seven as moderate two as high and none as very high what is flu forecasting influenza flu places a significant disease burden on the us population each year but the magnitude and timing varies from season to season making the annual impact difficult to predict at the beginning of each season flu forecasting can change that by predicting in advance when the start peak and increases in flu activity will occur unlike cdcs traditional influenza surveillance systems which measure influenza activity after it has occurred flu forecasting offers the possibility to look into the future and better plan ahead potentially reducing the impact of flu \n",
